Captain Ghalt! Sgt. Igrin reporting!

First! I wish to express my gratitude for bringing me into the fold. It's a mighty fine fold. Well... mostly fine fold. Second! Per your request, I've worked up readiness evaluations on all of your recruits. If I may speak freely, Captain: these are the sorriest, saddest excuses for soldiers as I've ever encountered, and if this is what we're putting up against the Jennerit and the Varelsi, I'm afraid we're screwed. Screwed beyond reckoning. Unless we do something about it.

If you want to get these worthless pukes whipped into shape on the double, I've got a training regimen that just might do the trick. Fair warning: boot camp with Sgt. Igrin is the kind of nightmare that'll make the Varelsi look like sleepy kittens by comparison.

I am not kind.
I am not friendly.
But I AM effective.

I can't promise that everyone will make it through. Hell, I can't even promise they'll survive. But if this outfit of yours is to stand any chance in the wars to come, we need to pack these pukes into a blender, set that bastard to purée, and pour what's left over into a mold that vaguely resembles a solider. That'll get us halfway there. And what'll make up the difference? Discipline! Courage! Fire-forged grit!

One last note: I'm going to pay special attention to Benedict. He's no stranger to my brand of training, but apparently it didn't take the first time around. Being that this is a matter of my record, my personal pride, Benedict's going to be the star pupil of Camp Ernest aboard Nova. I'll make a solider out of that arrogant ass yet — just you watch.
