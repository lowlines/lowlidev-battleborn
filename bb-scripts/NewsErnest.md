**ERNEST GAMEPLAY REVEAL**

Ernest is explosive on the battlefield, but he isn’t in this fight for glory or vengeance. Some might call him a well-aged boy scout, but Ernest’s sense of honor and duty brings a new means of support and defense previously absent from the Peacekeepers – this is no small part thanks to his grenade launcher. The various explosive ordinance rounds help Ernest lean on the offensive or provide a mean line of defense for his team. As one of Menneck B’s premiere demolitions experts, he’s a brilliant tactician, known for his “outside the box” perspective on decimating his foes.

Steadfast, courageous, and prepared for just about any threat, Ernest Igrin is a paragon of the Peacekeeper ethic: strength through unity, and through strength, liberation for all!

Born to a family of soldiers, Ernest always believed it was his destiny to die in the service of his people, on the field of battle. But his path veered a bit when, at a young age, Ernest demonstrated a keen understanding of rescue operation logistics, cleaning up after disasters and coordinating demolition projects to free survivors of earthquakes and other natural disasters.

As the Varelsi scourge reared its miserable head in Ernest’s native Menneck system, though, the demobird felt powerless to do anything about it, cleaning up the aftermath. That’s when Ernest signed up for general combat duty in the UPR. Ernest’s considerable talents with explosive ordinance translated fluidly to combat, and he accomplished much in his three years alongside the Rapid Deployment Corps.

When the war finally arrived on Menneck’s doorstep, Ernest begged for reassignment to his home system. The aviant that returned was different than the one who left. His optimism, tempered and hardened. His spirit and devotion to his people, however, remained intact. In the battle to save Menneck, Ernest served on the front lines of the evacuation. Following his homeworld’s darkening, Ernest returned to the United Peacekeeping Republics as an instructor, readying new recruits for the conflicts ahead.
