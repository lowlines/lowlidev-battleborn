<font color="#B2CC80">Oscar Mike:</font> Benedict?!? Benedict?!...Want a cracker? Because that's what birds like, right?!

<font color="#B2CC80">Montana:</font> This isn't like Benedict. I mean he's like...well...he's in the air and flies around and stuff. It's not like him to get pinned in by Varelsi. He's as slippery as a greased Thrall.

<font color="#B2CC80">Oscar Mike:</font> Maybe...Ugh. I can't believe I'm gonna say this. Maybe he was..."Winging it" and things went south?

<font color='#BFBFBF'>(Montana laughs)</font>

<font color="#B2CC80">Montana:</font> Went south! That's funny!

<font color="#B2CC80">Oscar Mike:</font> Huh? Well. Um...Anyway. If the UPR quartermaster did the job they're supposed to be doing, they would've approved our supply requisitions before we ran low on artillery and got overrun!

<font color="#B2CC80">Montana:</font> You gotta think about where those supplies would come from, bud. Anyone we'd take'em from is out there fighting, too.

<font color="#B2CC80">Oscar Mike:</font> Yeah? Like who?

<font color="#B2CC80">Montana:</font> Like the Eldrid.

<font color="#B2CC80">Oscar Mike:</font> They're just collateral damage.

<font color="#B2CC80">Montana:</font> Collateral damage! How could you say something like that?!

<font color="#B2CC80">Oscar Mike:</font> Stop sucking up to the brass, Monty. You're so focused on keeping everyone safe, you just end up making decisions that put people more in harms way.

<font color="#B2CC80">Montana:</font> Well, my bad for not just indiscriminately blowing everything up!

<font color="#B2CC80">Oscar Mike:</font> I didn't say anything about blindly destroying things, but at what point are we going to go "All In" at stopping this war?

<font color="#B2CC80">Montana:</font> "All In" shoudn't mean sacrificing the people we're trying to save. If we do that, what do we really accomplish?

<font color="#B2CC80">Oscar Mike:</font> More than wasting our time trying to get a semi-flightless bird to trigger his nesting instinct. Right Benedict?!!? Man, I hate that Aviant!

<font color="#B2CC80">Oscar Mike:</font> Look bud. All I'm trying to say is, the longer we drag this out, the more the difficult choices become the only choices, and I for one can think of a million better ways I could be spending my afternoon.

<font color="#B2CC80">Montana:</font> Yeah? Like clearing out spider colonies on Orobon VII?

<font color="#B2CC80">Benedict:</font> Well, hey! *Urgh* It's a man mountain *Nnf!* and copy-boy! I got something stuck in this here...craw.

<font color="#B2CC80">Oscar Mike:</font> Man I really hate this guy.

<font color="#B2CC80">Benedict:</font> I could really use some help...You know...Who wants to be my wingman?!!

<font color='#BFBFBF'>(Benedict laughs)</font>

<font color="#B2CC80">Benedict:</font> Give that back you tentacled freak!

<font color="#B2CC80">Montana:</font> Yep. Save them all. Even this guy.

<font color='#BFBFBF'>(Benedict laughs hysterically)</font>
