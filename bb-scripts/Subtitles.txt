; C1, “Prologue” intro (“the stone”)

C1_Kleese_01="Let's bring you up to speed, shall we?"
C1_Kleese_02="So, once upon a whole hell of a long time ago, the very first civilization in all the known universe carved an idea into a STONE."
C1_Kleese_03="And this, of course, meant it was important."
C1_Kleese_04="Their idea was about...\n "
C1_Kleese_05="Their idea was about...\nTHE END."
C1_Kleese_06="According to... the stone... a time would come when EVERYTHING would disappear, including the very stars themselves."
C1_Kleese_07="A vast darkness would devour the heavens, and after YEARS of...\nlet's call it the longest chain of very bad days ever, only ONE star would remain."
C1_Kleese_08="All those capable would travel to this last star, fleeing the darkness and death throes of a dying universe."
C1_Kleese_09="However, this gathering would not produce unity, but WAR."
C1_Kleese_10="War among beings and civilizations, and war against great foes: the Varelsi, and the Betrayer, Rendain."
C1_Kleese_11="But the stone also speaks of hope: champions who arise from the ashes of conflict."
C1_Kleese_12="Those who, well... those who want to keep the lights on."
C1_Kleese_13="And this is where YOU show up."
C1_Kleese_14="From among these heroes, you will recruit a force forged in conflict."
C1_Kleese_15="You will direct and train them, and through you, there is hope for light."
C1_Kleese_16="This force will be...\n "
C1_Kleese_17="This force will be...\nthe BATTLEBORN."
C1_Kleese_18="And for you, Commander, they will fight together, or they will die alone."
C1_Kleese_19="If you believe stones, that is."
C1_Kleese_20="Which brings us back to the star..."

C2_Deande_01="DEANDE\nMellka, come on!"
C2_Kleese_02="KLEESE\nI say we airlock her."
C2_Mellka_03="MELLKA\nI'm with him."
C2_Ghalt_04="GHALT\nDeande's our only hope of a shot at Rendain, and we only get that shot when he makes his play at the star."
C2_Mellka_05="MELLKA\nAnd until then? What's our plan?\nI mean, if we HAVE a plan."
C2_Ghalt_06="GHALT\nWe're gonna bust up the Imperium's operations around Solus, buy ourselves as much time as we can, and rally support from the factions.\nFortunately for us, they need all the help they can get."
C2_Ghalt_07="GHALT\nBlowing stuff up's workin' out good so far. I was thinkin' we'd do more of that."
C2_Ghalt_08="GHALT\nWhile Rendain's repairing the Heliophage, we'll help the other factions get back on their feet.\nWe'll need 'em all behind us if we're gonna pull this off."
C2_Ghalt_09="GHALT\nThe UPR's been taking heavy losses tryin' to reclaim their old settlements on Bliss.\nAdmiral Bannon put out a call for assistance. We could start there."
C2_Mellka_10="MELLKA\nWord from the Observatory is that Ekkunar is crawling with Jennerit harvest crews. We could disrupt their energy supply lines if we hit 'em hard."
C2_Deande_11="DEANDE\nTempest is more vulnerable than even Rendain realizes. It'll be dangerous... but they probably won't see us coming."
C2_Kleese_12="KLEESE\nSo, we're not airlocking... anybody?"
C2_Ghalt_13="GHALT\nShut up, Kleese."
C2_Deande_14="DEANDE\nThis is our last chance to save Solus. We must not fail."
C2_Ghalt_15="GHALT\nWe won't."
C2_Kleese_16="KLEESE\nEhhh, we might."
C2_Mellka_17="MELLKA\nOh my god, SHUT UP, Kleese!"

C3_Ghalt_14="GHALT\nDeande? Still with me?"
C3_Deande_15="DEANDE\nHm. It's a beautiful day."
C3_Deande_16="DEANDE\nWhat news from Bliss?"
C3_Ghalt_17="GHALT\nOh, you know. Not great. Ran into another portal bloom... probably gonna die..."
C3_Ghalt_18="GHALT\nAw, COME ON!"
C3_Deande_19="DEANDE\nYou guys get all that?"
C3_Kleese_20="KLEESE\nNaturally! Climb aboard!"
C3_Deande_21="DEANDE\nRendain's defeated, and Solus is safe. For the moment."
C3_Deande_22="DEANDE\nBut this war may never end. Triumph bought us time... not peace."
C3_Deande_23="DEANDE\nThe Varelsi may never relent... and neither will we."

Observ_Intro_Mellka_03="MELLKA\nThe sole surviving member of the team has called for reinforcements to help finish the experiment, and apparently... it's Boldur."

Evac_Intro_Rendain_03="RENDAIN\nHi. It's Rendain. Remember the other day, when you foiled my plans?\nWell, you finally convinced me that the Eldrid threat can no longer be ignored."
Evac_Intro_Rendain_04="RENDAIN\nSo I'm destroying Ekkunar, and all the life it harbors, and perhaps most notably the Eldrid Codex."

Cath_Intro_Ghalt_04="GHALT\nNo idea, but I know one thing for sure: none of us are gonna die in the dark."
