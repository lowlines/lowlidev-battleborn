FinalPrivacyPolicy="<u>GEARBOX SOFTWARE, LLC</u><br><u>PRIVACY POLICY</u><br><br>Last updated July 24, 2014<br><br>Welcome to SHiFT!<br><br>In order to make the experience as entertaining — and transparent — as possible, we have adopted the Privacy Policy (“Policy”) below.  Because the use of SHiFT, its related sites and services (collectively, “SHiFT”) first requires acceptance of the below Policy, please take a moment to familiarize yourself with them.<br><br>SHiFT is designed to foster a relationship between SHiFT members (“Members”) and Gearbox entertainment.  Ideally, the relationship between our content and our community will grow stronger and more robust as SHiFT matures.  To help facilitate this process, information is exchanged between Members, their equipment and SHiFT. We respect that Members are trusting us with their information.  We’re committed to being reasonable custodians of information — individual, personal or otherwise — obtained from Members.  The types of information we collect are detailed below.  SHiFT is a service for videogames accessible through a website. The SHiFT service itself does not track Members through the use of “cookies” or collect personal information.  Websites use cookies and are capable of tracking Members unless the Members block cookies and turn on the Do Not Track option.<br><br>Obviously, use of SHiFT is voluntary.  This includes any channels provided for interacting with other Members.  Some Members like to run with the pack, while some don’t; neither preference is wrong.  If you are uncertain about sharing data at all, please forego use of SHiFT entirely until you achieve the level of comfort you need.  We have no desire to make the experience awkward or difficult.<br><br>Please don’t be bashful with your constructive compliments and criticisms — both are welcome.  If you have any thoughts or ideas about where things are/aren’t working well, we want to know that.  You can reach out to us directly to share your ideas at privacy@gearboxsoftware.com.<br><br>To foster the Member community, we intend to convey — and support — various promotions through SHiFT via emails to Members.  We’re determined to keep this from becoming annoying; if we’re failing, please let us know.  Members who wish to do so, may use the “unsubscribe from this list” or “update subscription preferences” links located at the bottom of any email you receive from SHiFT; or you can delete your account to stop such communications.<br><br>All Members must be over the age of 13 to use SHiFT, and at least 18 years of age to access some games in SHiFT. SHiFT does not intentionally collect personal information from children under the age of 13, and any such information will be deleted upon discovery.<br><br>To fully enjoy the services available through SHiFT, Members should create an individual account, and must respect the rights of others throughout their use.  Like a bad roommate, Members who detract from SHiFT will be promptly evicted from the SHiFT community.  No Member is entitled to use of SHiFT or its content at the expense of other Members.<br><br>Links to other websites are provided for Member convenience and information; those links have their own terms, conditions, and privacy policies.  Members may also be bound by the separate terms of their respective software, products, platforms, hardware and equipment.  We recommend that you carefully review all such terms.<br><br>Members understand and agree that SHiFT is provided “AS-IS” and without warranties or duties of any kind.<br><br>Again, the official Policy is below... game on!<br><br><u>PRIVACY POLICY:</u><br><br>Gearbox Software, LLC, a United States company, its partners and affiliates (collectively “Gearbox”), respects the privacy rights of those who access and use its services and is committed to protecting the information collected through its online products, services, and websites accessed through any internet-capable hardware platform including gaming consoles, personal computers, mobile computers, or smart phones, or in-game applications or any software platform including third-party hosts (collectively the “Online Services”).

If you choose to provide us with other personal information, it may be linked to the non-personal information stored by these technologies.<br>•	Cookies: A “cookie” is a small bit of record-keeping information that websites often store on a user's computer. Our cookies do not include people's names or e-mail addresses; they are typically used to quickly identify a Member’s computer, browser, or device and to “remember” things about prior visits (such as the Member’s use of various features on the service). You can disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent to your computer; however, disabling cookies may affect your ability to use certain Online Services.<br>•	Web Beacons: A “web beacon” is an electronic image that allows websites to count users who have visited certain pages or viewed certain advertisements.<br>•	Internet Log Files: Gearbox may also keep track of IP addresses used to access its Online Services for various reasons. An IP address is a numerical number that is used by a networked device and will identify your point of connection to the internet. Depending on your network configuration, it may also identify your computer, or other device. A MAC address or other device ID identifies one specific piece of hardware. These identifiers may be tied to your personal information in certain circumstances, such as if you have linked your console user account to Online Service accounts offered by Gearbox.<br>•	Analytic Metrics Tools and Other Technologies: Other information that may be passively collected by Gearbox includes information about your hardware, product use, service use, or website use, including website navigation and game telemetry activity.
