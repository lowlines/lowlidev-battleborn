**ALANI GAMEPLAY REVEAL**

Alani is the last vestige of an Eldrid monastic warrior enclave on the freshwater ocean planet, Akopos. Raised with a deep reverence for water, Alani learned to embody and manipulate low-viscosity fluids with the use – er – rather, the warranty-breaking misuse of a water-soluble nanotech. This technology and her training allows her to manipulate water all around and even within her own body, healing injury and ailments.

The order’s peaceful existence was abruptly interrupted as Rendain attempted to claim what he believed to be an uninhabited planet for the Jennerit Imperium. Alani’s people struck back quickly but were cut down as the Jennerit turned their weapons against them. Alani fought back, but not before she was witness to her own order’s destruction.

As a warrior from a planet with vast seas, Alani’s attacks and abilities revolve around her power to control water to dish out pain, or heal her fellow Battleborn. Read about each of her attacks and abilities below and watch them in action in the video above.

**TORRENT:** Through years of training in Ket, her order’s martial art, Alani has honed her ability to control water, hurling water bolts to damage enemies.

**WELLSPRING:** Channeling her focus and strength, Alani heals herself for a small amount or envelopes an ally in water to heal them.

**RIPTIDE:** Alani sends forth a wave of water that deals damage to enemies, pushes them away, and leaves a trail hastening allies’ movement speed.

**GEYSER:** Calling upon the power of the oceans, a groundswell erupts, knocking enemies into the air, damaging and binding them.

**EMERGENCE:** Alani summons a water dragon that deals damage to everything caught in its wake.

**(Passive) OSMOSIS:** Alani’s healing abilities swell and recede like the tide. Successfully landing hits with Torrent grants up to three stacks to temporarily increase the healing power of Wellspring.

Check out all of Alani’s awesome abilities and helix augmentations in action in her official Let’s Play video below.

**INTRODUCING PENDLES!**

Hailing from the water world of Akopos, and pals with Alani, Pendles is a cold-blooded killer. No, literally. This anthropomorphized reptile will ssssneak up on you, poison you, perforate you with dual kamas then – poof – disappear without leaving a trace. Oh, yeah, and he wears a dope pair of sneakers.  Get it? “Ssssneaky”?!? Wears sneakers?!? (Fine…fine.) This Rogue’s rogue may be a cold-blooded assassin-for-hire, but Ghalt felt was safer to have him on the team, than not.
