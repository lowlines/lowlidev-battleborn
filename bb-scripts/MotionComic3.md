Ghalt and his UPR soldiers are ordered to evacuate immediately, but he doesn't intend to leave anyone behind.

<font color="#B2CC80">Ghalt:</font> Ghalt, to Peacekeeper Command, Sector 23 evac complete. Proceeding to Sector 25.

<font color="#B2CC80">UPR Command:</font> That's UPR, Captain Ghalt. Please remember to use formal designations when on UPR coms. Roger on the Sector 23 evac. Transit to Sector 25 confirmed.

<font color='#BFBFBF'>(Ghalt sighs)</font>

<font color="#B2CC80">Ghalt:</font> Roger that.

<font color="#B2CC80">Ghalt (speaking off coms):</font> Damn bureaucracy. Be the end of us.

<font color="#B2CC80">Ghalt:</font> Nova, status report. What's the view up ahead?

<font color='#33CCCC'>Nova:</font> We are entering combat airspace. Looks to be some Jennerit on the ground 50 clicks ahead, they are engaged with Varelsi and Imperium forces.

<font color="#B2CC80">Ghalt:</font> This isn't good - they're about to get glassed! Nova, bring us around and get ready to pop the hatch.

<font color='#33CCCC'>Nova:</font> Sir, shouldn't we stick to the mission? Given that the rapidly degenerating state of the star - see what I did there? De-Jennerit-hating? Anyway, the current state of aggression necessitates a tight window of operations. Our orders from UPR Command requires us to focus our evacuation efforts exclusively on UPR soldiers.

<font color="#B2CC80">Ghalt:</font> Have we thought through every tactical advantage here, Nova? We might lose Penarch, but there's still another fight ahead.

<font color='#33CCCC'>Nova:</font> Mathematically speaking, the Jennerit rebels would provide a tactical improvement against the Varelsi. However, if I were to calculate their odds of survival based on the current numbers of Thrall and Varelsi they are facing along with our current...

<font color="#B2CC80">Ghalt:</font> Don't care! If we're going to stand any chance of winning we would improve our odds with that kind of firepower on our team. Turn us around!

<font color="#B2CC80">Ghalt:</font> Ghalt, to command. Requesting emergency evac of Jennerit rebels in Sector 24.

<font color="#B2CC80">UPR Command:</font> Again, that's UPR Command, Captain. UPR Command, to Ghalt. Request denied. Proceed to Sector 25.

<font color="#B2CC80">Ghalt:</font> Commander, we need everyone we can spare, from the way they're decimating Varelsi and Imperium forces on the ground, I think their loyalty has proven.

<font color="#B2CC80">UPR Command:</font> I repeat. UPR Command denies this request. Jennerit cannot be trusted.

<font color="#B2CC80">Ghalt:</font> UPR Command, we need to evac now. Penarch is almost fully darkened. These warriors won't stand a chance if we leave now.

<font color="#B2CC80">UPR Command:</font> This isn't open for debate, Captain - you have your orders! Besides, I've just called in an orbital strike on this target. In 5 microns there won't be anything left for you to pick up.

<font color="#B2CC80">Ghalt:</font> An orbital strike! Commander, these heroes could aid our cause!

<font color="#B2CC80">UPR Command:</font> Get your head straight, Captain. UPR guidelines state that we can't leave any supplies or tech for hostiles to make use of after we pull out. We're clearing the area. Proceed to Sector 25 immediately. Get your ship away from the strike zone now.

<font color='#BFBFBF'>(Ghalt abruptly rips out the communication relay)</font>

<font color="#B2CC80">Ghalt:</font> Command, Nova is experiencing some, uh, difficulties.

<font color='#33CCCC'>Nova:</font> Hey...

<font color="#B2CC80">Ghalt:</font> Must be irregularities caused by this uh, Varelsi darekening nodes being moved into position. We've got to do an emergency touch down to ensure everything is operating correctly. That is UPR protocol, correct?

<font color="#B2CC80">UPR Command:</font> Captain Ghalt! Your are violating a direct ord...

<font color='#BFBFBF'>(static)</font>

<font color="#B2CC80">Ghalt:</font> Asshat...Nova! Prepare for evac.

<font color='#BFBFBF'>(Nova crashes down on Varelsi horde)</font>

<font color="#B2CC80">Ghalt:</font> Did someone call for a lift? Looked like you guys could use a hand.

<font color="#CC0000">Ambra:</font> We had the situation under control.

<font color="#B2CC80">Ghalt:</font> So I'll...take that as a "thank you."

<font color="#CC0000">Ambra:</font> And where will you be taking us...Captain Ghalt, isn't it?

<font color="#B2CC80">Ghalt:</font> I'll explain once we get off this rock. Think you might be interested in a rendezvous I have planned with another Jennerit defector. And a few other friends. Yeah, I think it might be time to give them the call.
