<font color="#B2CC80">GHALT:</font> This session will cover—

<font color="#CC0000">AMBRA:</font> Stated for record, both I and Verod Rath have been promised full amnesty and total non-liability for any actions taken while under the orders of the criminal usurper Lothar Rendain.

<font color="#B2CC80">GHALT:</font> You don't have to open every interview with that.

<font color="#CC0000">AMBRA:</font> Just good housekeeping.

<font color="#B2CC80">GHALT:</font> Last time, you mentioned an incident that earned you some flak from Rendain.

<font color="#CC0000">AMBRA:</font> Ah. Yes. I was the ranking priestess aboard the ship Meistar, returning from the oversight of a shard harvest in the Kalokk system. We received orders directly from Rendain to reroute and assist a reservoir fleet orbiting a world we knew then only as 627.88.

<font color="#B2CC80">GHALT:</font> It got a new name since?

<font color="#CC0000">AMBRA:</font> It already had one — Akopos. It was a freshwater ocean world, an astounding rarity even when the universe was larger. It was an ideal source for the fleet, a "no brainer" as you lowborn seem to luxuriate in saying. Unfortunately, the fleet commander made a jarring discovery as he began the siphon — 627.88 was less uninhabited than previously thought.

<font color="#B2CC80">GHALT:</font> Why did they need your help?

<font color="#CC0000">AMBRA:</font> Some of the planet's native population took issue with the confiscation of their oceans and attacked the gravity siphons. They showed unusual control over the water — summoned rogue waves and whirlpools up from calm seas. The fleet wasn't equipped to pacify a non-compliant world. So my Sisters and I were instructed to neutralize any resistance, without dragging us into a long invasion campaign.

<font color="#B2CC80">GHALT:</font> You found a diplomatic solution.

<font color="#CC0000">AMBRA:</font> We boiled them. And sterilized our drinking water in one motion.

<font color="#CC0000">AMBRA:</font> Stated for record—

<font color="#B2CC80">GHALT:</font> They know.

<font color="#CC0000">AMBRA:</font> You're uncomfortable.

<font color="#B2CC80">GHALT:</font> Last time you admitted to wiping out an entire planet's population. Yeah, I'm uncomfortable.

<font color="#CC0000">AMBRA:</font> It was Rendain who gave the order! My refusal to act on it would have meant nothing. Their vaporized blood is on his hands. Or fogging up his windows, perhaps. Anyway, the aren't all gone. There was one...

<font color="#B2CC80">GHALT:</font> You encountered a survivor?

<font color="#CC0000">AMBRA:</font> After. Right after. She must have sneaked aboard the Meistar while we were near the surface, preparing for the ritual. Whatever her goal was at the time, she accidentally found herself in the safest place she could be. With the finest seats in the house, too.

<font color="#B2CC80">GHALT:</font> She saw her whole culture destroyed — at your hands.

<font color="#CC0000">AMBRA:</font> It was—

<font color="#B2CC80">GHALT:</font> Rendain. Sure.

<font color="#CC0000">AMBRA:</font> But we paid for his crime. This girl... I have never seen grief tempered by such a fearsome will. She nearly tore the ship apart as she came for us, drowned my Sister one after another. She surged over them like the ocean itself.

<font color="#B2CC80">GHALT:</font> You're here to talk about it.

<font color="#CC0000">AMBRA:</font> I was on the bridge, watching this storm of a girl dismantle my entire retinue. Even though I knew I could defeat her. I was transfixed by the sight. By the time she reached me, I had made my decision: I offered her the ship, in exchange for my escape. Whatever her reasoning may have been, she accepted.

<font color="#B2CC80">GHALT:</font> And Rendain held you accountable for the loss of the ship.

<font color="#CC0000">AMBRA:</font> The ship didn't matter to him, nor did the Sisters who died on it. He was revolted that I had surrendered. But he didn't see ser. She was a hellraiser, the like of which I had not seen since... long before.

<font color="#B2CC80">GHALT:</font> It almost sounds like you respect her.

<font color="#CC0000">AMBRA:</font> I do. I even gave her a ribbon off my cloak.
