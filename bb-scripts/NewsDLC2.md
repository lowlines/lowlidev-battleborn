Someone stole Berg and there’s gonna be hell to pay! Toby will do anything to get his custom-built, death-dealing mech suit back in his own hands…. uh, flippers. Battleborn’s second Story Operation, “Toby’s Friendship Raid,” has you fighting your way through LLC manufacturing facilities, dodging traps, scrapping minions, and most importantly: GETTING BERG BACK!

**INTRODUCING BEATRIX**

Precise. Deadly. Obsessively hygienic.

Beatrix has a fondness, if not obsession, with manipulating living creatures. With her prosthetic syringe-arm, she can inject enemies at range, spreading debilitating debuffs and disease across the battlefield. A scientist at artificial-heart, Beatrix is ready to apply a lethal dose of Jennerit intellect and ruthlessness straight to Rendain.
