<p align="center">THE YEAR 19957
IN THE PENARCH SYSTEM
ON THE JENNERIT SPACECRAFT EXODUS
_______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<font color="#CC0000">Rendain:</font> At last, Penarch is nearly veiled!. Why it's only a short matter of time until we ascend. One can only imagine what it will be like on the other side.

<font color="#CC0000">Deande (Reading):</font> Initiating Final Phase

<font color="#CC0000">Rendain:</font> Hellooooo?? Deande?? Ah, your lists. Always with the lists! After all these years I'm astonished you haven't memorized the process.

<font color="#CC0000">Deande:</font> My apologies, Lord Commander, but it is these very lists that ensure your carefully laid plans unfold with such precision.

<font color="#CC0000">Deande (Reading):</font> Varelsi and Thrall forces deployed on the ground. Sources report that all five factions are nearly overrun. Jennerit technicians are spinning up the Heliophage. Full power in three macrons. Varelsi portal opening in 45 microns.

<font color="#CC0000">Rendain:</font> Tell me, Spymistress, how many veilings have we witnessed?

<font color="#CC0000">Deande:</font> That depends on your classification Lord Commander. Do you mean all those that we have witnessed since the Varelsi appeared in our universe, or after our ah, alliance?

<font color="#CC0000">Rendain:</font> Since I ensured the survival of our people, Spymistress. Something the Empress would have never accomplished.

<font color="#CC0000">Deande (Reading):</font> Penarch will darken within the hour.

<font color="#CC0000">Deande:</font> Penarch will make our 301st veiling in five years marked by the second Battle of Jennar, and your agreement to 'The Passage'.

<font color="#CC0000">Rendain:</font> And the illustrious beginning of the Jennerit Imperium. So much accomplished in such a short period of time...You do realize, Deande, that your lists will soon be of no use. Our work is nearly complete. Penarch will be nothing more than a dark stain in a matter of microns and soon too will Solus fall into the dark.

<font color="#CC0000">Rendain:</font> After the darkening is complete, we will move the Heliophage to Solus immediately. With the current state of the opposition, our Thrall forces on Tempest should make short work of them.

<font color="#FFCC00">Message Received:</font> Penarch will darken within the hour.

<font color="#B2CC80">Ghalt:</font> Thanks for the tidbit. Rounded up a few that can help. Going to get them off this rock while we still can.

<font color="#CC0000">Deande (Thinking):</font> For all the good it's worth. Information has done little to save our world. Not the fate of the Empress, nor stop the darkening of even one of those 300 stars. From countless stars, billions illuminating the galaxy...Now only two left. I'm out of time. The Passage must not be completed.

<font color="#CC0000">Deande:</font> Um...Excuse me Lord Commander, there appears to be a situation on the ground that I must deal with personally.

<font color="#CC0000">Rendain:</font> Indeed you must. Farewell, Deande.

<font color="#CC0000">Deande (Messaging):</font> Room for one more?
