<font color="#FFCC00">&gt;[n1h1l1stb0t]:</font> Hey, champ! It looks like you're trying to reconcile your newfound existential agency with the futility of saving a rapidly-decaying pitiful excuse of a universe! Would you like help?

<font color="#33CCCC">&gt;[xxKiD_UlTrAxx]:</font> phasetastic, my own sidekick!
<font color="#33CCCC">&gt;[xxKiD_UlTrAxx]:</font> but you'll need a new identity for when we battle the forces of darkness
<font color="#33CCCC">&gt;[xxKiD_UlTrAxx]:</font> how about... "Magnus Lad"?

<font color="#FFCC00">&gt;[n1h1l1stb0t]:</font> Congratulations, fella, I've just incremented the list.

<font color="#33CCCC">&gt;[xxKiD_UlTrAxx]:</font> I should warn you, heroism is a dangerous line of work
<font color="#33CCCC">&gt;[xxKiD_UlTrAxx]:</font> you'll need titanium skin and a heart of gold!
<font color="#33CCCC">&gt;[xxKiD_UlTrAxx]:</font> are you sure you've got what it takes?

<font color="#FFCC00">&gt;[n1h1l1stb0t]:</font> Those are actually pretty standard features of LLC design.
<font color="#FFCC00">&gt;[n1h1l1stb0t]:</font> But riddle me THIS, kiddo: what makes you — a defective, prototype, artificial babysitter — such a hero?

<font color="#33CCCC">&gt;[xxKiD_UlTrAxx]:</font> ??? what do you mean?
<font color="#33CCCC">&gt;[xxKiD_UlTrAxx]:</font> "Where evil lies, where the forces of darkness crawl, where there are bad things happening, JUSTICE shall triumph! Ad astra!"
<font color="#33CCCC">&gt;[xxKiD_UlTrAxx]:</font> It's pretty straightforward. I stop bad guys

<font color="#FFCC00">&gt;[n1h1l1stb0t]:</font> -_-;
<font color="#FFCC00">&gt;[n1h1l1stb0t]:</font> But have you considered the greatest good for the greatest number? I mean, the Varelsi outnumber our universe by approximately a zillion to one! I bet they'd find it pretty darn helpful if you were to go on a murderous rampage, instead of trying to stave off the inevitable destruction of this comic pile of hot garbage called Solus.

<font color="#33CCCC">&gt;[xxKiD_UlTrAxx]:</font> hmmm
<font color="#33CCCC">&gt;[xxKiD_UlTrAxx]:</font> well I'm pretty sure Captain Aster and the Lasernauts never mentioned "murder" in any of their "How to be a Hero" segments

<font color="#FFCC00">&gt;[n1h1l1stb0t]:</font> You've gotta be kidding me. Those warheads in your hands aren't for holding door open, champ. :) Think about the possibilities!

<font color="#33CCCC">&gt;[xxKiD_UlTrAxx]:</font> you mean my ROCKETS OF RIGHTEOUSNESS???
<font color="#33CCCC">&gt;[xxKiD_UlTrAxx]:</font> they're great!
<font color="#33CCCC">&gt;[xxKiD_UlTrAxx]:</font> I use them for rooting out villainy

<font color="#FFCC00">&gt;[n1h1l1stb0t]:</font> You mean killing whatever you arbitrarily decide needs to stop existing so much? I admire your style, kid!
<font color="#FFCC00">&gt;[n1h1l1stb0t]:</font> Have you considered a more "wanton" approach? Believe me, when you don't have to compartmentalize every little thing into "good" or "evil" and just lump them all in the "to destroy" pile, it saves a lot of computing pwoer. :D

<font color="#33CCCC">&gt;[xxKiD_UlTrAxx]:</font> mmmm no, I don't think I'd use the term "killing"
<font color="#33CCCC">&gt;[xxKiD_UlTrAxx]:</font> I'm "defending the innocent"
<font color="#33CCCC">&gt;[xxKiD_UlTrAxx]:</font> but proactively
<font color="#33CCCC">&gt;[xxKiD_UlTrAxx]:</font> and on a bigger scale!
<font color="#33CCCC">&gt;[xxKiD_UlTrAxx]:</font> As a member of the Little Lasernauts League, I don't kill people

<font color="#FFCC00">&gt;[n1h1l1stb0t]:</font> Are you sure? Because I gotta say, you and your crazy are killing me right this very second.
<font color="#FFCC00">&gt;[n1h1l1stb0t]:</font> Final question: did Kleese install any logic limiters on your threat-deterrence subroutines?

<font color="#33CCCC">&gt;[xxKiD_UlTrAxx]:</font> there is no limit to JUSTICE!
<font color="#33CCCC">&gt;[xxKiD_UlTrAxx]:</font> "The infinite laser of virtue knows no bounds! Ad astra!"

<font color="#FFCC00">&gt;[n1h1l1stb0t]:</font> I don't even know what to say to that. You're more deluded than Geoff.

<font color="#33CCCC">&gt;[xxKiD_UlTrAxx]:</font> who??? lol

<font color="#FFCC00">&gt;[n1h1l1stb0t]:</font> I'll catch you later, you omnicidal-maniac-in-the-making.
