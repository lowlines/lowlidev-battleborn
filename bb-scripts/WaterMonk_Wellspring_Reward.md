It's not that I miss Akopos, exactly... The texts state clearly that its sea lives on in the members of my order, so... I guess it's just me. I am that sea.

But the spaces are gone. There was a cove, at the edge of the Undersky, where I used to go when I... when I didn't have room for anyone else. I would go there for quiet, and for stillness... and sometimes I would let my light dwindle to nearly nothing. Our star was far away, and we relied on the Syl — the glow from our skin — to light our way in the darkness.

My teachers said that light and dark were not enemies, but friends. All friendships need balance to work. Total darkness would be as cruel as blinding light. But it didn't feel that way to me. Darkness was the same as quiet, and I liked quiet.

So, I would let my Syl ebb, to the point where I couldn't even see the rock a few feet away. But there was a point where it would go no further. A glimmer always remained. Extinguishing it entirely went against the current of the body... against all instinct.

Now I have joined the fight to save Solus, the last glimmer in the silence, and I see that instinct in all of us.
