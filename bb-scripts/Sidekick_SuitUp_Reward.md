Hey Kleese, Kid Ultra here!

I was hoping you could help me out with some gadgets for fighting crime! I was thinking, maybe a bola-thrower? Dr. Noxtopus uses bolas to incapacitate bad guys, and he's pretty much the expert on battling injustice.

As a matter of fact, I've already begun work on some custom upgrades to your frightfully non-lethal arsenal. I WAS going to install a molecular disruptor plasma array, but I guess with the rockets, that might be a bit redundant, eh?

I suppose I could... yes, a "bola snare", wrapped with a phasic envelopment charge! That'll really "put the hurt on them", so to speak! Also, who is Dr. Noxtopus? I haven't seen his name cited in any of the dozens of scientific journals I subscribe to.

Dr. Noxtopus! Trillionaire philanthropist criminologist by day, were-octopus crime-fighter by night! He's the leading researcher in the field of underwater crime, he sometimes helps Fragnus the Star-barian.

Also, just wanna make sure - I don't think these should be TOO painful, you know? That phasic business sounds pretty intense! Double also, did you say rockets! Like rocket-boots?? You'll make me fly???

No flying. My airspace is crowded enough with that damnable Benedict buzzing about. No, I mean ROCKETS, my dear boy. Long-range, fire-and-forget, totally unguided point-and-click EXPLOSIVES!

Yeah, maybe I phrased it wrong. Can you just give me a shock taser like yours? I just want to subdue my foes, like Dr. Noxtopus.

One: you will NEVER get ANYTHING "like mine". Do you have any idea how expensive this battle throne was? Duplicating any of its features would reduce its value enormously.

Two: the rockets ARE for subdual! Subdual... with extreme prejudice.

Three: Dr. Noxtopus sounds stupid. Why not fully devote himself to criminology and stop the spread of violent crime at the source through education initiatives and penal system updates, rather than waste his nights in egoistic fisticuffs?

Well, when you put it that way, the bola and rockets sound great! I can't wait to try them out and subdue some evildoers!

Also, Doc Nox contributed BILLIONS to charitable organizations last year. He takes more of a global-welfare stance by day, he just beats up the bad guys in his own city by night. "Dr. Noxtopus 'nox' out crime, one sucker at a time!"

Whatever.
