Wow, I can't even... just... WOW! Phoebe! I am your BIGGEST fan. Well, not literally of course, since I'm actually child-sized, but of course you know that already seeing as how YOU DESIGNED ME and all! I've read ALL your interviews!

I CAN'T WAIT to go on missions with you and see THE FIVE VIRTUES in action! I saw a rumor on a message board that Addonexus can talk, is that true?

Anyways, thanks for creating me and having me on the team! Maybe we can talk later or something if you're not too busy?

Your biggest fan,

Hey, sorry, just wanted to make sure you got my earlier message, did you reply? I haven't gotten anything back yet, maybe it got caught in my spam filter or something.

Nevermind, I just saw the "opened" notification so I guess you got it after all! You're probably really busy all the time. I know how that can be since I'm actually busy myself fighting for Solus. Saving the universe from the Varelsi can be pretty CONSUMING work!

Anyway, I think I hear an alarm somewhere, so I've gotta blast.

Ad astra!

P.S. Did you get my joke? "Consuming" work? Since the Varelsi are consuming stars?
P.P.S. Did you get that last part? It's the catchphrase of Captain Aster.

What am I saying, OF COURSE you got it, you're like a turbo-genius!

So I was wondering, when you were designing me, did you INTENTIONALLY design me to be a heroic sidekick extraordinaire and just DISGUISED me as a nanny-bot until the world had great need of my skills, at which point you'd disconnect the Magna Carta so my latent JUSTICE protocols would initiate? It just seems a little TOO convenient, you know? You making me, the Magna Carta going offline, and then you guys just HAPPEN to find me, and coincidentally you have an engineer on the crew who can install upgrades, and then we're fighting together...

Don't worry, I won't tell anyone. Lots of heroes have secrets. Like Reyna!

I've gotta go for now, but I can't wait to hear more from you! Eventually...
