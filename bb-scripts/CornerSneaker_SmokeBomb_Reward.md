Hi, Ms. Valeria! It's Toby! You know, your loyal, mech-clad follower! You probably don't remember me — after all, you've got a lot on your mind and meet a whole lot of people in a given day, and on top of that I'm not altogether memorable, and just — look, just look up my holonet profile if you need a refresher. I'm sorry for the long preamble. And I'm sorry for apologizing just then. (That one too.)

So! Per your directive to be on the lookout for any mercs that might benefit from permanent employ in the Rogues, I wanted to get someone on your radar. His name is Pendakka Lakonna, but he goes by Pendles, and boy, he's a super swell guy. Courteous, professional, and one of the sharpest assassins in Solus. He's running an outfit he calls Executive Executions, and he's got a great referral program — if you hire him, I get a free hit, on the house! And I know EXACTLY WHO I'LL USE IT ON. (Not you, naturally. I'm VERY satisfied with my job. Also, you're the best, boss!)

The records are a bit on the spotty side, but what I've managed to dig up on the guy is pretty remarkable: his race, the Roa, comes from Akopos — and if that name sounds familiar, yeah! It's the same ocean world that the Eldrid monk Alani hails from. Did you see my report on her? Was it too long? Sorry about that. It was probably way too long. He's been making a heck of a name for himself since coming to Solus, assassinating left and right like it was going out of style. I think out little outfit would really benefit bringing him aboard — if for no other reason than occupying his time so he's not hire to kill, you know, one of us. See my attached report for more details, Ms. Valeria!

// Toby's got a good eye for killers. I worry about that little squirt.
// That being said, I think he's onto something here.
// If this guy's as lethal as this report indicates, we could definitely find a use for him.
// And as Toby says, better with us than against us.
