Denizens of Solus! Ever have one of those problems that you just can't solve on your own? Trouble with the boss, disputes with a neighbor, or irreconcilable differences with a spouse and their lucrative life insurance policy?

Have you ever thought to yourself, "Gosh, I could make this all go away with the judicious application of cold-blooded murder, but I'm a bit too soft-hearted to swing the axe m'self"? Then you need to call on Executive Executions!

I'm Pendakka "Pendles" Lakonna, sole proprietor and star assassin of EE, and I'm here to tell you that there isn't any problem that a good ol' fashioned assassination can't solve.
