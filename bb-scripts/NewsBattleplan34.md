<font color="#B2CC80">GHALT:</font> Huh. That was…surprisingly painless. And you’re saying this injection is going to help my knees?

<font color="#CC0000">BEATRIX:</font> Almost assuredly. Or what’s LEFT of those pitifully collagenic patellae you generously call “knees”. As your primary-and-only-competent-care physician, I really must recommend we work something mechanical in there. Maybe…tritanium? All you UPR grunts love tritanium!

<font color="#B2CC80">GHALT:</font> Yeah, on the OUTSIDE. Replacing my skeleton? SO not gonna happen.

<font color="#CC0000">BEATRIX:</font> Your loss. Captain, would you kindly bring the next patient in?

<font color="#B2CC80">OSCAR MIKE:</font> Sup, Cap—hey, where’s the doctor?

<font color="#CC0000">BEATRIX:</font> You’re looking at her. Have a seat, Mr…Mike. I’m going to need you to remove your combat armor and helmet.

<font color="#B2CC80">OSCAR MIKE:</font> My…what? No way! I’m just here for the free band-aids.

<font color="#CC0000">BEATRIX:</font> Is he always like this?

<font color="#B2CC80">GHALT:</font> Pretty much.

<font color="#CC0000">BEATRIX:</font> Oscar, I’m going to ask one more time: pretty please, with sugar on top…

<font color="#B2CC80">OSCAR MIKE:</font> Look, if I wasn’t in MEGA-PEAK CONDITION, could I do THIS? Bam! Totally healthy, no armor removal necessary!

<font color="#CC0000">BEATRIX:</font> I was hoping it would come to this.

<font color="#B2CC80">OSCAR MIKE:</font> To what?

<font color="#CC0000">BEATRIX:</font> We don’t have an infracarbon-saw aboard this ship…yet. But I pride myself on innovation in the face of adversity, and I’ve made some…mostly positive findings thus far with this bladed boomerang I borrowed, and an electric toothbrush I’ve recoupled to the med-bay’s primary generator. This should be interesting. Nova, begin recording.

<font color="#33CCCC">NOVA:</font> Hm? Oh, I record pretty much everything, everywhere, all the time.

<font color="#CC0000">BEATRIX:</font> Now THAT’S creepy. Remind me to check your archives later. Captain, restrain the patient.

<font color="#B2CC80">OSCAR MIKE:</font> Uhhhh…CAPTAIN, PERMISSION TO NOT BE RESTRAINED. Ha! Take THAT, spooky doctor girl!

<font color="#B2CC80">GHALT:</font> Permission denied.

<font color="#B2CC80">OSCAR MIKE:</font> You can do that?

<font color="#B2CC80">GHALT:</font> Yup. Unless you want to lose that chest plate and helmet, soldier.

<font color="#B2CC80">OSCAR MIKE:</font> But…it’s cold! Awww, man!

<font color="#B2CC80">GHALT:</font> And the base layer.

<font color="#CC0000">BEATRIX:</font> He’s blue?

<font color="#B2CC80">GHALT:</font> Well, sure. What, you’ve never seen a Galahadrim’s skin before?

<font color="#CC0000">BEATRIX:</font> They lose their pigment on expiry.

<font color="#B2CC80">GHALT:</font> What does—oh. Yeah, he’s blue.

<font color="#B2CC80">OSCAR MIKE:</font> Do you need me to open my mouth and say “ahhh”?

<font color="#CC0000">BEATRIX:</font> No. In fact, do the opposite. Keep it closed, say nothing.

<font color="#BFBFBF">[negligible background noise for 10 seconds]</font>

<font color="#CC0000">BEATRIX:</font> Incredible…and you’re certain this is one of the RDC’s quick-culture clones?

<font color="#B2CC80">GHALT:</font> Yeah, I’ve got it on pretty good authority.

<font color="#B2CC80">OSCAR MIKE:</font> Don’t tell the others!

<font color="#B2CC80">GHALT:</font> Riiiight. Anyway, why do you ask?

<font color="#CC0000">BEATRIX:</font> He’s actually remarkably healthy compared to most Galahadrim I’ve examined. I mean, all my specimens were also dead and suffering from a variety of injuries, but even so, almost all of them had evidence of pre-existing conditions stemming from ribosomal degradation. It’s exceedingly rare for the quick-culture process to “take” without a host of issues arising…at least, not without specific care to the specimens throughout the maturation phase.

<font color="#B2CC80">OSCAR MIKE:</font> See? What’d I tell ya! I’m pretty much the greatest.

<font color="#CC0000">BEATRIX:</font> Captain, why did the UPR select Galahadrim for the program? As opposed to, say, Aplians? Their musculature is significantly further developed. Or the Aviants? Superior mobility, collectivistic instincts, quicker gestation, shorter juvenile period…

<font color="#B2CC80">GHALT:</font> Well, originally, it was going to be an Aplian-based program, but changed to Galahadrim just a few months before the program began for a couple of reasons…

<font color="#B2CC80">OSCAR MIKE:</font> Further developed MY ASS! Captain! Permission to wrestle!

<font color="#B2CC80">GHALT:</font> Denied.

<font color="#B2CC80">OSCAR MIKE:</font> Damn!

<font color="#CC0000">BEATRIX:</font> Yes, but why, Trevor, WHY did it change? If there’s some Galahadrim-specific physiological component of the cloning process, I need to know, both for my own research and to adequately care for Mr. Mike and Mr. Foxtrot.

<font color="#B2CC80">GHALT:</font> No, no, it’s nothing like that, it’s. Well. Have you ever seen Montana eat?

<font color="#CC0000">BEATRIX:</font> Oh. Oh my. The caloric intake necessary to feed an army of mountains must be—

<font color="#B2CC80">GHALT:</font> “Expensive as all hell,” was the official line. The Galahadrim—

<font color="#CC0000">BEATRIX:</font> I’ve seen their digestive tracts before, opened stomachs with corroded rocks and raw meat mixed with standard UPR rations. They’re efficient. I see. And the other reason?

<font color="#B2CC80">GHALT:</font> Hm?

<font color="#CC0000">BEATRIX:</font> You said “a couple of reasons”, what’s the other reason for Galahadrim clones?

<font color="#B2CC80">GHALT:</font> Oh. Uh. Well, at the time, the UPR was going through an aggressive recruitment campaign, you know, lots of “visit exotic places and blow them up!” kinda posters…

<font color="#CC0000">BEATRIX:</font> I don’t follow.

<font color="#B2CC80">GHALT:</font> Well, the UPR’s Ministry of Media decided that some blue would…[sigh]…”pop” more. And we didn’t have a big enough population of Helicians, something about “staple variance factors”, I think?

<font color="#CC0000">BEATRIX:</font> Stable variance factorization. You need a particular threshold of genetic diversity to carry out a mass-cloning operation such that any unforeseen mutations don’t propagate enough generational momentum to impact the population as a whole.

<font color="#B2CC80">GHALT:</font> Uh huh.

<font color="#CC0000">BEATRIX:</font> So…he’s blue.

<font color="#B2CC80">GHALT:</font> Yup.

<font color="#B2CC80">OSCAR MIKE:</font> And BADASS! And healthy as heck!

<font color="#CC0000">BEATRIX:</font> Right. Well, I have some archived footage to review. Oscar, I believe we’ve BOTH earned ourselves a piece of candy.

<font color="#B2CC80">GHALT:</font> Candy?

<font color="#BFBFBF">[Drawers opening and closing, metal clattering]</font>

<font color="#CC0000">BEATRIX:</font> Captain, WHERE is the candy?

<font color="#B2CC80">GHALT:</font> Uhhh…

<font color="#CC0000">BEATRIX:</font> HOW can I be expected to perform my medical duties if I CAN’T PROPERLY INCENTIVIZE MY PATIENTS? Or my SELF? Or my assistant!

<font color="#B2CC80">GHALT:</font> Assistant?

<font color="#CC0000">BEATRIX:</font> I’m filing a requisition order. Nova! We need candy for the med-bay!
