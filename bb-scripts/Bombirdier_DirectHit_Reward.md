Eyes up, recruits! This is a 40-millimeter grenade. And it's a very special grenade. Anybody care to guess why?

<font color="#BFBFBF">(No response.)</font>

Because it's YOURS!

You're gonna keep this grenade till it grows up. It's gonna get bullied, it's gonna endure several rites of passage, and you'll see it through every step of the way as a proud grenade mom and/or dad.

You'll take it to grenade school and get it acquainted with brand new grenade friends in litle league. You'll take gobs of pictures of your little bundle of joy. And where are you going to keep those pictures? In your WALLET! Or FRAMED on a MANTELPIECE! The choice is yours, maggots!

Right now it's just a pile of powder and iron, but when it's ready to be fired at the nearest unsuspecting hostile? It's gonna become something MORE!
