Children: they're dangerous, dumb, emotionally-draining creatures that prey upon the relic of biological instinct to get what they want, usually your attention.

The Crimson Terminus is defending her championship titles against rising contender El Drag√≥n in a no-holds-barred cage match at the Galactic Holo-Arena, but your kid wants to stay home and watch the "Fragnus the Star-barian" holiday special. Are you going to miss the match of a lifetime?

Well now, you don't have to!

The Hemsworth Intelligence Enterprise is proud to present the latest prototype from its Homeowner Heuristics division, the "Kid Ultra" nanny-bot! Driven by the technologically infallible Magnus AI system, networked to the LLC ultra-intelligence the Magna Carta, Kid Ultra is the ultimate substitute for parental care:
<ul>
<li>Designed and developed by Phoebe Elizabeth Audelia Mensworth IV of Hemsworth Intelligence Enterprises, the most trusted name in Magnus technology applications!</li>
<li>Advances in artificial physiognomy from Virtual Visage Ventures have led to the most lifelke, non-threatening, un-uncanny face ever seen on a Magnus!</li>
<li>Psychoadaptive projection display evaluates your child and tunes into the matchematically-proven most placating holoshow selected from over 60,000 simulcast serials on the LLC's network! Up to 1.6 exabytes of episodes are automicatlly encoded into Magnus memory for guaranteed lossless playback eons after the end of the Universe!</li>
<li>Modular "HemsWire" ports are compatible with the entire HIE line of consumer modules, from Hemsworth Arms to Hemsworth Zenith - configure and customize your Kid for home defense, astrogation, or anything in between!</li>
<li>Internally housed deployable Asclepius Drones can passively monitor an area or be assigned to follow a child, transmitting up-to-the-femtosecond updates on vitals and administering aid as necessary. Helicopter parenting is a thing of antiquity - drone parenting is the future!</li>
</ul>
