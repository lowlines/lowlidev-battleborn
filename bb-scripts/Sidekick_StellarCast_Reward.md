<font color="#33CCCC">Kid Ultra:</font> Okay, from the top, just like I wrote it!

<font color="#BFBFBF">(Phoebe sighs wearily.)</font>

<font color="#33CCCC">Phoebe:</font> Meanwhile, in the crystal citadel of the Federation of Galactic Heroes...

<font color="#33CCCC">ISIC:</font> Ha-HA! Now that my betrayal is complete, I, the super-duke of all crime, control every version of the Federation of Galactic Heroes across all timelines! Hahahaha!

<font color="#33CCCC">Phoebe:</font> But wait. Someone is coming.

<font color="#33CCCC">Rath:</font> It is me, King of the Vampires! I have come for you... wait, "blord"? Is this right? "Blord"?

<font color="#33CCCC">ISIC:</font> Gasp!

<font color="#BFBFBF">(Phoebe signs again, muttering through gritted teeth.)</font>

<font color="#33CCCC">Phoebe:</font> This is excruciating.

<font color="#33CCCC">Kid Ultra:</font> Look, just read the script! It'll be awesome, I promise!

<font color="#33CCCC">ISIC:</font> Yeah, I don't know what you're talking about! This is quality stuff!

<font color="#33CCCC">Phoebe:</font> I'm leaving.

<font color="#33CCCC">Kid Ultra:</font> No! Wait! Come back! Just think of the merchandising opportunities!
