The disastrous evacuations at Menneck may have been one of the UPR's greatest failures, but I'll be damned if the system's heroes didn't rise to the occasion. Case in point: Sgt. Ernest Igrin, one of Menneck-B's premiere demolitions experts, and by far one of the most decorated candidates to cross my desk. This aviant's got a service record a mile long, and unlike Benedict, he's pretty well-regarded by his peers and reports alike.

And best of all, Ernest's a born leader. He spent most of his time prior to the Darkening of Menneck building special weapons teams and training new recruits in explosives handling and bomb defusal, and earned himself a reputation as one of the hardest, most disciplined instructors of his generation. According to his record, he defied his commanding officer's orders to evacuate with his squad just hours before Menneck was darkened, rallied a couple of extra pairs of hands, and blasted his way through a collpased subway tunnel to free over 300 civilians trapped inside.

Gonna keep my eye on this one. We could use a demolitions expert, and hell, maybe he'll have better luck whipping Benedict into shape than I did  â€” or at least get him to tone it down a notch or two.
