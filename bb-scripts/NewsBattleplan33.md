<font color="#B2CC80">OSCAR MIKE:</font> Kleese! It’s Oscar Mike here. I found this AWESOME clip of a scalewolf pup walking around like a person, and I was gonna send it to everyone as a holomail attachment, but there’s a MAJOR problem. I’ve been HACKED, bro! I can’t open my holomail stuff!

<font color="#33CCCC">KLEESE:</font> Oscar. I’ve told you time and again, before coming to me with every little thing, first manually induce a full capacitance flux sequence via the primary power coupling.

<font color="#B2CC80">OSCAR MIKE:</font> Right. Uhhhh… I got everything up until “first”, then you lost me.

<font color="#33CCCC">KLEESE:</font> Bottom of your station, right hand side, that is, the same side where you hold your gun, there’s a large button. Push the button, wait five seconds, then push it a second time. Off, then on again. Also, PLEASE refrain from gumming up Nova’s PA system with your inane blathering, this channel is reserved for emergency address only.

<font color="#B2CC80">OSCAR MIKE:</font> That’s what I’m saying, there’s an emergency with my holomail address! My contacts, my newsletters, my fact-a-day messages, this is seriously HECKED UP. I’ve been hacked to heck!

<font color="#33CCCC">KLEESE:</font> [prolonged audible sigh] What is your holomail address?

<font color="#B2CC80">OSCAR MIKE:</font> “BRO-M83.1101@rdcnet.mik”

<font color="#33CCCC">KLEESE:</font> Let’s have a look then, shall we?

<font color="#B2CC80">OSCAR MIKE:</font> It’s B-R-O –

<font color="#33CCCC">KLEESE:</font> – YES, yes, I get it, you’re very clever. While you were busy struggling with your spelling, I figured out your issue. You weren’t “hacked”, your account has been suspended and archived. There’s a note here, it seems that the administrator finally caught wind of your persistent violations of the “official communications only” bit of the terms of service.

<font color="#B2CC80">OSCAR MIKE:</font> Wrong! The only dudes with admin access are the Mike High Command, and all the other Mikes have been SUPER-gone for pretty much ever.

<font color="#33CCCC">KLEESE:</font> Well—

<font color="#B2CC80">OSCAR MIKE:</font> They’re gone and never coming back, Kleese, and you’ve gotta accept that, like I have! You’ll never see or hear from them again, no matter how close you guys were before, no matter how much fun you had shooting Varelsi faces or swapping stories or playing rock-paper-airstrike. It’s in the past! There’s no use dwelling on those guys, just appreciate the bros you’ve got, instead of crying and writing poems about bros you lost.

<font color="#33CCCC">KLEESE:</font> Ohhhkayyy, or, HERE’S A THOUGHT, instead of opening up WAY more than I’m comfortable with, you can submit a support ticket to contact the administrator directly.

<font color="#B2CC80">OSCAR MIKE:</font> …You can do that?

<font color="#33CCCC">KLEESE:</font> No, YOU can do that, I’m done with IT for the day. Have fun reconnecting. HA!
