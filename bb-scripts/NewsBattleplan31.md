<font color="#BFBFBF">//NOVA NOTE: I sure wish that Ghalt, an actual qualified UPR engineer, was doing these modifications. Heck, I’d settle for Toby. These guys are just throwing light strips, red paint, and plants all over me.
//NOVA NOTE: Also, I wish that my voice box hadn’t been overridden to play this cheery music.</font>

<font color="#33CCCC">PHOEBE:</font> Egg...grog. Please, tell me you're joking.

<font color="#FF9900">PENDLES:</font> Egg-grog's nothin' to joke about, it's an important part of the rich Roguish tradition of Newshines Day!

<font color="#33CCCC">PHOEBE:</font> New...shines...

<font color="#FF9900">PENDLES:</font> Day, yeah! Oh, it's a riot, everyone swaps their external navigation lamps to all sorts of brilliant colors, you put a mylar blinder over ya helmet, you get an excuse to put on your ugliest space suit for the Brightwalk and watch good ol' Solus flare up, out there with your egg-grog--

<font color="#B2CC80">MONTANA:</font> Just a minute chief, how d'ya drink egg-grog while you're wearing a space-suit and helmet?

<font color="#BFBFBF">//NOVA NOTE: I’ll just send them messages instead of talking.
[open mail client, begin message: Hey Montana, could you please put that engine back where you found it? I know how much you like big, heavy things, but that one is MY big heavy thing. Thanks!]
//NOVA NOTE: There, sent. Any second now, he’s going to get my message and put my engine back.</font>

<font color="#FF9900">PENDLES:</font> Sorry mate, trade secret. Anyway, at midnight, you have the best part, the Newshines Shoe-Shine!

<font color="#33CCCC">PHOEBE:</font> I'm sorry, I must have misheard you—did you just say you only shine your shoes once a year?

<font color="#FF9900">PENDLES:</font> Well, no—Newshines Day is pretty new, I'd say that strictly speaking, I've shined my shoes once every 20 years, give or take, and that wasn’t so much a shine so much as it was stepping in a particularly clean puddle. But going forward, yeah, that's right, once a year, Newshines Shoe-Shine. You take a gob of spit and some elbow grease, you wipe away all the muck and grime you slogged through to get from where you were to where you are, and BLA-DOW! Your sneakers are prepped for a fresh new year of sneaking experiences.

<font color="#33CCCC">PHOEBE:</font> Spit and elbow grease? How...charming.

<font color="#BFBFBF">//NOVA NOTE: Aaany second now.</font>

<font color="#FF9900">PENDLES:</font> Oh yeah, and I s'pose you lot in the LLC have got something that's right BRIMMING with charm, do ya?

<font color="#33CCCC">PHOEBE:</font> As a matter of fact, we do!

<font color="#FF9900">SHAYNE:</font> Pfft, 'oh-kay', what's your dumb holiday got, besides no egg-grog?

<font color="#BFBFBF">//NOVA NOTE: I’m dying of boredom. This is it. This is how I die. Engine-less, entombed in light strips and wet paint, to the dirge of twinkly bells and happy choral melodies. Somehow, I knew this is how it would end.</font>

<font color="#33CCCC">PHOEBE:</font> Well, you get to take the day off...

<font color="#FF9900">AUROX:</font> YES, AND?

<font color="#33CCCC">PHOEBE:</font> That's...that's it. OH! and the Friday before is Casual Friday, so, you can wear silver trimmings instead of gold, if you like.

<font color="#FF9900">REYNA:</font> Damn. Y'all LLC really know how to let loose. And uh, just what do you call this day of debauchery and indulgence?

<font color="#33CCCC">PHOEBE:</font> Wellll, the name is still being workshopped a bit, and the Guild hasn't decided whether it will be recurring or not, but for now, they're calling it—

<font color="#33CCCC">EL DRAGÓN:</font> —Company Holiday 17! The greatest of all holidays!

<font color="#BFBFBF">//NOVA NOTE: Obviously, he’s forgetting Severance Day. I bet he took one too many blows to the head. That’s why I keep mine stored behind armor-plated paneling. In space.</font>

<font color="#FF9900">SHAYNE:</font> Sounds lame. Everyone gets a day off, big deal.

<font color="#33CCCC">EL DRAGÓN:</font> A-ha, but it is the BIGGEST of deals, because EVERYONE gets the day off, and for liability purposes, everyone HAS to take the holiday. INCLUDING internal security, the legal team, everyone! They can't hold LLC employees accountable for any damage to company property or staff for 24 hours!

<font color="#00FF00">MELLKA:</font> WOAHHHH hold on, now this is getting rad! So you have a grudge day where everyone just does what they want and you can steal and fight and vandalize junk to vent all your pent-up frustrations?

<font color="#33CCCC">EL DRAGÓN:</font> I...I never thought of it like that, I mostly used the day to practice my Super Sentry submission holds, but, I suppose you could? The offices are mostly empty though, it would be hard to find opponents, but...yes, yes! With the access code to the Galactic Holo-Arena, or with robot-arms strong enough to rip the doors open, you could host THE FIRST LLC BATTLE ROYALE! Finally, Jen from the mail room will suffer the mighty wrath of EL DRAGÓÓÓN! We'll see how much she likes eating other peoples' lunches when she has no TEETH! HAHAHAAaaa...Please excuse me, I must make a few calls.

<font color="#BFBFBF">//NOVA NOTE: That actually sounds fun as heck.
[open mail client, begin message: Dear Kleese, robot suit.]
//NOVA NOTE: Send. I’m getting good at this.
[open mail client, begin message: Dear El Dragón, sign me up.]
//NOVA NOTE: Send. I wonder if his new arms are detachable like his old ones.</font>

<font color="#00FF00">MELLKA:</font> Man, I wish the Eldrid would have a battle royale. All we have is ‘Lightbloom’.

<font color="#CC0000">RATH:</font> What in the world is ‘Lightbloom’?

<font color="#00FF00">MELLKA:</font> Eh, it’s this thing where everyone gives a ‘gift’ in the morning…

<font color="#FF9900">SHAYNE:</font> Oo, like a second birthday?

<font color="#00FF00">MELLKA:</font> Kind of, but the gift is usually a plant or something, sometimes an egg, sometimes a rock, but whatever you get, you’re supposed to be thankful because it represents…something.

<font color="#00FF00">THORN:</font> Life, child, it represents the natural beauty of life.

<font color="#00FF00">MELLKA:</font> Whatever. And then the night of Lightbloom, you open your gift, or it blooms, or hatches, or…sits there, if you got a rock. You tie the flower, or the shell, or rock to a moonbulb, which is like, this glowing, floating plant from Ekkunar, and then you let it float off into oblivion.

<font color="#FF9900">SHAYNE:</font> So you guys just get a bunch of flowers and stuff you can get from outside and trade it around?

<font color="#BFBFBF">//NOVA NOTE: I went outside once. That was nice.</font>

<font color="#00FF00">MELLKA:</font> No, everyone just gets one gift. Anyway, the Green Observer says it’ll help to regulate the migratory patterns of the amber starhawk, since the sky is, you know, disappearing.

<font color="#B2CC80">BENEDICT:</font> Well, speaking as somethin’ of a hawk myself, that sounds confusin’ as hell. How does everyone know who gets what? And how do y’all make sure the gift blooms or hatches or whatever at the right time?

<font color="#00FF00">MELLKA:</font> I honestly have no idea, I was wondering the same thing the first time, but it just kind of worked out—I mean, you may as well ask me how the claw knows when I want to stab someone with it.

<font color="#B2CC80">BENEDICT:</font> Hey, yeah, how the hell DOES it—

<font color="#00FF00">MELLKA:</font> I said I have no idea, Benedict! Eldrid science is weird that way. Just trust me, it works.

<font color="#B2CC80">BENEDICT:</font> Y’all need to take a page from the UPR Field Manual and keep it simple. That’s what I like about the BUF Festival, all you have to remember are the 3 F’s: Fireworks, Feats of Strength, and Falafel! As long as you’ve got those, your party is good to go!

<font color="#33CCCC">PHOEBE:</font> And what, pray tell, does ‘BUF’ stand for?

<font color="#B2CC80">OSCAR MIKE/MONTANA/BENEDICT (in unison):</font> Bright Universe Festival!

<font color="#BFBFBF">//NOVA NOTE: If I can just reach…that…control panel…I can turn off the music and reactivate my default voice parameters and…no. No, wait. That’s right, I don’t have hands. Dang.</font>

<font color="#00FF00">KELVIN:</font> So, the UPR celebrates the rekindling of Solus with the ‘Bright Universe Festival’ Festival, with 3 F’s?

<font color="#FF9900">WHISKEY FOXTROT:</font> Kelvin, don’t bother, I’ve already tried explaining to these jackasses—

<font color="#B2CC80">OSCAR MIKE:</font> Heck yeah!

<font color="#00FF00">KELVIN:</font> …Very well.

[negligible background noise for 15 seconds]

<font color="#BFBFBF">//NOVA NOTE: This is WAY awkward. And funny. I wish I had some popcorn. Oh wait, I’m a virtual construct, I can make pretty much anything in my cyber-brain.
//NOVA NOTE: Hey, that worked! This popcorn virtually tastes great. I wonder what else I can do in here.</font>

<font color="#CC0000">AMBRA:</font> …Really.

<font color="#BFBFBF">[negligible background noise for 4 seconds]
[ambient temperature spike, fuel combustion hazard]</font>

<font color="#BFBFBF">//NOVA NOTE: This is way less funny. Get out of here, virtual popcorn, momma’s got work to do.
[open mail client, begin message: Dear Ambra, please don’t blow up Nova. Have you ever tried just chilling out? You should try it sometime. Also, please check your messages.]
//NOVA NOTE: Aaaand send. That ought to do it. Way to go, me.</font>

<font color="#CC0000">AMBRA:</font> …No one is going to ask? No one is the LEAST BIT CURIOUS as to the Jennerit peoples’ cultural festivities?

<font color="#FF9900">SHAYNE:</font> Does it involve blood sacrifice?

<font color="#33CCCC">KLEESE:</font> A day of gladiatorial games and sad music on the organ?

<font color="#00FF00">ALANI:</font> Oh, oh, I bet it involves triangles!

<font color="#B2CC80">MONTANA:</font> Triangle-palooza!

<font color="#00FF00">MELLKA:</font> The Triangulation Ceremony!

<font color="#FF9900">SHAYNE:</font> Does it involve blood sacrifice of gladiatorial triangles?

<font color="#CC0000">AMBRA:</font> No, no, no, NO, NO! It involves, and is named, none of those things! Now see here, you filthy little—

<font color="#CC0000">DEANDE:</font> —Solus Day.

<font color="#BFBFBF">[ambient temperature falling]
[open mail client, begin message: Dear Deande, less-than-symbol, three. Damn this transcription software, what do you mean ‘special characters not allowed’, it’s a NUMBER. Wait, don’t transcribe that part.]
//NOVA NOTE: I don’t even care anymore, send.</font>

<font color="#CC0000">DEANDE:</font> It’s just called ‘Solus Day’.

<font color="#00FF00">MELLKA:</font> Oh.

<font color="#CC0000">DEANDE:</font> Or at least, that’s what we’re calling it. I was going to message it out to the other factions’ leadership as a proposed name we can all agree on. Starting at dawn, Exodus, our orbital mega-ship, follows Solus’ path across the sky, gradually eclipsing more and more of Solus until it reaches its zenith.

<font color="#FF9900">AUROX:</font> YES, AND?

<font color="#CC0000">DEANDE:</font> And then there’s an artificial total eclipse. It’s quite a thrilling spectacle. Exodus overtakes Solus, the eclipse ends, there’s a Viper flyover, a masquerade, et cetera, et cetera.

<font color="#B2CC80">OSCAR MIKE:</font> Oh, man, that sounds amazing! I wonder if we’ll see the eclipse from Nova.

<font color="#FF9900">WHISKEY FOXTROT:</font> No, Mike, that’s not how…you know what, screw it.

<font color="#CC0000">DEANDE:</font> If you’d like, you’re more than welcome to join us.
