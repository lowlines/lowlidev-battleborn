Toby. Ernest here. Being that we're gonna be squaddies for the forseeable future, I want to tell you a little story about yours truly.

As you know, Aviants come in all shapes and sizes, but we, as feathered fellows, generally get lumped into two categories: the flyers, and the flightless. That's been the line drawn in the sand since time immemorial, and as a fellow flightless fella, it's been a thorn in my backside since I was hatched. Seems like you've been suffern' under the same indignation.

But I'm here to tell you, solider: us flightless type? We're carved outta woood. We had to work twice as hard, hustle twice as fast, and be twice as smart as our airborne counterparts. We're the underdog. Bird! Underbird.

And that's been the fire under this old soldier's ass since the day he entered the service — and you got that same fire, kid. Under your ass! And in your heart! And in, uh, your, uh... colorful language.

But a soldier's gotta own that fire, Toby. You gotta hold it in your hands — uh, flippers! You've got flippers — you hold it in your flippers and you forge it into something more!

So what if you can't fly?! You've got a propellant that beats the everlovin' pants offa wings — a propellant that'll launch you screaming into the stratosphere. That propellant? That's fire! This metaphor's extremely over-extended, but you get my drift, right? Right.

Listen up, Toby! Asshats like Benedict are always gonna rule the skies. I say let 'em. They don't got the heart that we do. They don't got the fire. Don't you ever lose that. If you do, I will PERSONALLY beat it back into you. Am I kidding? Do you REALLY want to find out? I think not!
