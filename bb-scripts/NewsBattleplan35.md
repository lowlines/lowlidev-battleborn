<font color="#FF9900">MAYZEMASTER|</font> alright losers, welcome back to Shayne’s MAZE of MADNESS!
<font color="#FF9900">MAYZEMASTER|</font> where’d we leave off?
<font color="#91d7f8">galilea|</font> The Tower of the Severed Hand. Hecta had just cast “Nonagon of Respite”, which grants the benefits of a full night’s sleep to Hecta and up to 8 allies.
<font color="#FF9900">MAYZEMASTER|</font> yeah yeah, I know how NoR works, just needed a quick reminder, I just woke up

<font color="#33CCCC">Phoebe.Hemsworth.IV|</font> Shayne!!
<font color="#33CCCC">Phoebe.Hemsworth.IV|</font> !clock

17:36 (Coordinated Standard Time)

<font color="#33CCCC">Phoebe.Hemsworth.IV|</font> What in the WORLD are you doing sleeping in this late? Wait, do the Rogues use CST?
<font color="#FF9900">MAYZEMASTER|</font> yeah I just sleep really late
<font color="#FF9900">MAYZEMASTER|</font> plus I was up til like 0530 on the navsim
<font color="#FF9900">MAYZEMASTER|</font> Reyna’s been letting me ride shotgun
<font color="#FF9900">MAYZEMASTER|</font> I’m pretty much the copilot, so I’m teaching myself to fly
<font color="#CC0000">Eurydice|</font> that’s awesome1
<font color="#CC0000">Eurydice|</font> awesome!*
<font color="#CC0000">Eurydice|</font> stupid prosthesis
<font color="#CC0000">Eurydice|</font> we’ll have to call you “CAPTAIN Shayne” pretty soon .P
<font color="#91d7f8">galilea|</font> You wouldn’t call her “Captain Shayne”, just like it’s not “Captain Trevor”. The rank is followed by the surname, so it would be Captain...
<font color="#33CCCC">Phoebe.Hemsworth.IV|</font> ...?
<font color="#FF9900">MAYZEMASTER|</font> no idea.
<font color="#FF9900">MAYZEMASTER|</font> speaking of, where’s our Death-Jester?
<font color="#FF9900">MAYZEMASTER|</font> still can’t get over that name
<font color="#33CCCC">Phoebe.Hemsworth.IV|</font> That reminds me, I need to change this bloody thing, I was in a meeting...

<font color="#FF9900">MAYZEMASTER|</font> Reyna won’t let me use the ansible without it...I think it’s a test or something
<font color="#CC0000">Eurydice|</font> My synthavox screws up the text-to-dpeech
<font color="#CC0000">Eurydice|</font> .(
<font color="#CC0000">Eurydice|</font> stupid Silent Sisters. Stupid surgeon.
<font color="#FF9900">MAYZEMASTER|</font> :frowning: sorry Beatrix
<font color="#FF9900">MAYZEMASTER|</font> let me know if we need to go slower
<font color="#91d7f8">galilea|</font> If anything, we need to go faster. Are we going to play, or not?
<font color="#33CCCC">HULKULEEZ!|</font> Yes, let’s! HULKULEEZ WANT BREAK PUNY THINGS
<font color="#00FF00">Mell|</font> I’m with feebs let’s get to killing this guy
<font color="#FF9900">MAYZEMASTER|</font> alright, alright, keep your loincloth on

a message has been pinned: “when we last left our heroes...”

<font color="#FF9900">MAYZEMASTER|</font> so, having fought your way through the Digi-lich’s lair, you arrive at last at the door to his chambers, a preponderance of grobblin corpses in your wake...
<font color="#33CCCC">HULKULEEZ!|</font> To say nothing of that poor Pixie door-guard.
<font color="#FF9900">MAYZEMASTER|</font> right
<font color="#91d7f8">galilea|</font> I thought we spared him?
<font color="#91d7f8">galilea|</font> I specifically recall Hecta using “Wreath of Shriving Shame” and rolling a critical success to get him to see the error of his ways.
<font color="#00FF00">Mell|</font> yeah while you were off doing your star knight ablutions or whatever I went back and killed that guy
<font color="#91d7f8">galilea|</font> Oh.
<font color="#00FF00">Mell|</font> yeah I really wanted that pixie halberd
<font color="#91d7f8">galilea|</font> Isn’t Nelka a Half-Human? Can she even wield it?
<font color="#00FF00">Mell|</font> I’ve been using it as a toothpick slash cheese knife
<font color="#91d7f8">galilea|</font> We don’t even have any cheese!
<font color="#00FF00">Mell|</font> yet
<font color="#00FF00">Mell|</font> we’ll find someone that has cheese soon enough
<font color="#00FF00">Mell|</font> and I’ll kill them too
<font color="#FF9900">MAYZEMASTER|</font> ENOUGH! You’re at the door.
<font color="#FF9900">MAYZEMASTER|</font> What...
<font color="#CC0000">Eurydice|</font> ?
<font color="#FF9900">MAYZEMASTER|</font> ...do you do?
<font color="#FF9900">MAYZEMASTER|</font> ------ Trix, I’m trying to build suspense!

user <font color="#FF9900">(MAYZEMASTER)</font> has been muted for (1) minute

<font color="#33CCCC">HULKULEEZ!|</font> “HULKULEEZ WANT BREAK!”
<font color="#33CCCC">HULKULEEZ!|</font> I’m going to show this door what for!
<font color="#CC0000">Eurydice|</font> Phebe wait, as an Animancer, I can communicate with trees and wooden objects
<font color="#CC0000">Eurydice|</font> and alsp since I’m a Dryad, I get a bonus to diplomacy rolls with them
<font color="#FF9900">MAYZEMASTER|</font> okay I’m back
<font color="#FF9900">MAYZEMASTER|</font> sorry Eurydice, but those abilities only apply to natural, un-hewn targets.
<font color="#FF9900">MAYZEMASTER|</font> won’t work on a door.
<font color="#91d7f8">galilea|</font> Hecta casts “Guileless Might” on Hulkuleez.
<font color="#FF9900">MAYZEMASTER|</font> nice! okay so as a Troglodon, Hulkuleez has a -3 intellect, so that’s +3 strength with Guileless Might.
<font color="#33CCCC">HULKULEEZ!|</font> Don’t forget my Berserker favored enemy!
<font color="#FF9900">MAYZEMASTER|</font> oh yeah. I forgot that Hulkuleez REALLY hates doors.
<font color="#FF9900">MAYZEMASTER|</font> that’s another +2
<font color="#33CCCC">HULKULEEZ!|</font> His grandfather was killed by a faulty portcullis! This one’s for you, pop-pop!

user <font color="#33CCCC">(Hulkuleez!)</font> rolled 1d19 (16)

<font color="#FF9900">MAYZEMASTER|</font> not bad! that's a modulated roll of 21
<font color="#FF9900">MAYZEMASTER|</font> Hulkuleez flexes his mighty Troglodonian muscles, whirls his electric morningstar around and WHAM, bashes the door to splintereens!
<font color="#CC0000">Eurydice|</font> nooooo
<font color="#91d7f8">galilea|</font> What does the party see?
<font color="#FF9900">MAYZEMASTER|</font> The air within the chamber hangs thick with a foul miasma that seems to choke the light out of the lone torch you can barely make out in the center of the room.
<font color="#CC0000">Eurydice|</font> I want to summin my shimmerwasps!
<font color="#FF9900">MAYZEMASTER|</font> good thinking.
<font color="#FF9900">MAYZEMASTER|</font> do you have the prerequisite chiminage?
<font color="#CC0000">Eurydice|</font> yes! I have...2 “dollops” of royal jelly from a glimmerbee queen
<font color="#FF9900">MAYZEMASTER|</font> so, drawn to the scent of the jelly, your shimmerwasps materialize! they cast light in a radius of 20 feet around the swarm
<font color="#CC0000">Eurydice|</font> I direct the swarm to the center of the room while cautiously following behind
<font color="#91d7f8">galilea|</font> Hecta stands next to Eurydice, with her shield raised in case of danger
<font color="#00FF00">Mell|</font> I guess I’ll follow behind and pull out my ninja stars
<font color="#FF9900">MAYZEMASTER|</font> your Juggling Knives of Jocularity?
<font color="#00FF00">Mell|</font> sure
<font color="#33CCCC">HULKULEEZ!|</font> Hulkuleez will stand in the doorway, over the shattered remnants of the door. In case it tries to get back up.
<font color="#33CCCC">HULKULEEZ!|</font> HULKULEEZ NO FALL FOR DOOR TRICKS LIKE GRANDFATHER
<font color="#FF9900">MAYZEMASTER|</font> As you advance, the torch at the center of the room seem to grow in brightness until all too late, you realize it’s not a torch at all!
<font color="#33CCCC">HULKULEEZ!|</font> Oh dear.
<font color="#FF9900">MAYZEMASTER|</font> With a deafening roar, the Digi-lich’s DRAGON opens its maw and unleashes a gout of cyber-fire!
<font color="#CC0000">Eurydice|</font> nooooo
<font color="#CC0000">Eurydice|</font> Dryads are weak againsy fiiiire
<font color="#91d7f8">galilea|</font> Hecta leaps in front of Eurydice to protect her!
<font color="#FF9900">MAYZEMASTER|</font> What’s Hecta’s Defense Rating?
<font color="#91d7f8">galilea|</font> 17.5

user <font color="#FF9900">(MAYZEMASTER)</font> made a concealed roll...

<font color="#FF9900">MAYZEMASTER|</font> You take 124 bits of fire damage!
<font color="#91d7f8">galilea|</font> You mean Hecta?
<font color="#FF9900">MAYZEMASTER|</font> yeah I mean Hecta
<font color="#91d7f8">galilea|</font> The Zomboid racial ability, “Renecrotize”, allows Hecta to desurrect after an unkilling blow.
<font color="#FF9900">MAYZEMASTER|</font> ugh, fine, anyway, as the cyber-fire dissipates, you see the Digi-lich standing just behind the dragon, cackling as he brandishes a glowing scepter about.
<font color="#FF9900">MAYZEMASTER|</font> (Digi-lich) “Fools! You’ll never defeat me! I know all your weaknesses, for you see, it is I,“
<font color="#FF9900">MAYZEMASTER|</font> he removes his cowl,
<font color="#FF9900">MAYZEMASTER|</font> “Vextro, your old mentor and patron!”
<font color="#00FF00">Mell|</font> gimme a sec I’m finishing this drink but I got something awesome coming up
<font color="#00FF00">Mell|</font> spoiler it’s another drink gimme another sec
<font color="#00FF00">Mell|</font> alright I’m gonna straight up Nelka this guy into the next century
<font color="#00FF00">Mell|</font> I’m gonna attack him with my cheese knife
<font color="#FF9900">MAYZEMASTER|</font> you mean the pixie halberd?
<font color="#00FF00">Mell|</font> yeah that
<font color="#FF9900">MAYZEMASTER|</font> okayyy...

user <font color="#00FF00">(Mell)</font> rolled 1d19 (19!)

<font color="#FF9900">MAYZEMASTER|</font> Fine, you hit, roll 1d1.5

user <font color="#00FF00">(Mell)</font> rolled 1d1.5 (1)

<font color="#FF9900">MAYZEMASTER|</font> You tickle him with the pixie halberd, dealing laughably small damage
<font color="#00FF00">Mell|</font> eh it’s enough
<font color="#00FF00">Mell|</font> he’s like deathly intolerant of any lactose right
<font color="#00FF00">Mell|</font> that’s what you said in the third session of the sintered soldier when we had to fight the iron golem twins who were terrorizing that dairy farm
<font color="#00FF00">Mell|</font> Vextro got some milk on him and nearly died or whatever
<font color="#00FF00">Mell|</font> need me to pull up the records
<font color="#FF9900">MAYZEMASTER|</font> ? you can’t save ansible data
<font color="#00FF00">Mell|</font> sure I can just not from a local rig
<font color="#00FF00">Mell|</font> gimme a sec gotta actually type

.>>patching ansible node 12.1a: “Codex Regrowth”
.>>establishing secure connection
.>>biosecurity confirmed, user: RedObserver

<font color="#00FF00">Mell|</font> !customsearch:“that thing Shayne said about Vextro being lactose intolerant that one time”

(1) result: “Vextro cries out in agony as the drop of milk lands on his arm. Wracked with pain, he tells you ‘Keep that stuff away from me, I’m DEATHLY ALLERGIC to anything containing lactose!’ through gritted teeth.”

<font color="#00FF00">Mell|</font> don’t test my codex fu kid
<font color="#FF9900">MAYZEMASTER|</font> ...okay, sure, but you don’t have any milk
<font color="#00FF00">Mell|</font> no but I do have cheese on the blade
<font color="#00FF00">Mell|</font> shrimp
<font color="#91d7f8">galilea|</font> I thought you didn’t have any cheese?
<font color="#00FF00">Mell|</font> I lied
<font color="#00FF00">Mell|</font> killed that dairy farmer and took his cheese

user <font color="#FF9900">(MAYZEMASTER)</font> made a concealed roll...

<font color="#FF9900">MAYZEMASTER|</font> well ----.

user <font color="#FF9900">(MAYZEMASTER)</font> has been muted for (2) minutes

<font color="#33CCCC">HULKULEEZ!|</font> Drat, I was quite looking forward to giving that brute a thrashing!
<font color="#CC0000">Eurydice|</font> I’m gonna grab some fro-yo til Shaybe gets back
<font color="#91d7f8">galilea|</font> Can you get me some?
<font color="#CC0000">Eurydice|</font> .D
<font color="#CC0000">Eurydice|</font> qe can shaaare!
<font color="#FF9900">MAYZEMASTER|</font> FINE. Vextro’s dead. “Oh no, cheese, my one weakness!” he cries. The orb of his scepter still gleams with palpable force.
<font color="#00FF00">Mell|</font> sweet
<font color="#00FF00">Mell|</font> I pick up the scepter
<font color="#FF9900">MAYZEMASTER|</font> Cool! So now you have the SCEPTER OF THE DRAGONARCH, so you can command his dragon and stuff. Shooould come in handy against the hordes of Deleterius the Unmaker!
<font color="#CC0000">Eurydice|</font> We should destroy it.
<font color="#FF9900">MAYZEMASTER|</font> What??
<font color="#00FF00">Mell|</font> yeah what
<font color="#CC0000">Eurydice|</font> It binds the dragon against its will, right?
<font color="#CC0000">Eurydice|</font> Like a slave?
<font color="#FF9900">MAYZEMASTER|</font> Kind of? More like an ally
<font color="#CC0000">Eurydice|</font> So the dragon wants ti help us?
<font color="#FF9900">MAYZEMASTER|</font> Sure
<font color="#CC0000">Eurydice|</font> because if that’s the case then we don’t need the scepter in the first okace
<font color="#CC0000">Eurydice|</font> place*
<font color="#CC0000">Eurydice|</font> if we need the scepter to get the dragon’s help, then we should desrtoy it.
<font color="#91d7f8">galilea|</font> Yes...if we subjugate this creature against its will, we’re no better than Deleterius himself!
<font color="#FF9900">MAYZEMASTER|</font> I feel like you guys are going a bit overboard
<font color="#33CCCC">HULKULEEZ!|</font> I agree with Shayne, I mean, do we even know that the dragon has free will for us to subjugate? Does it have true consciousness?
<font color="#33CCCC">HULKULEEZ!|</font> Come now, any Digi-lich worth his salt would have properly programmed the dragon to enjoy its work and know its station.
<font color="#FF9900">MAYZEMASTER|</font> Yeah, besides, you don’t have to command the dragon forever
<font color="#FF9900">MAYZEMASTER|</font> I just figured you’d use the scepter until you defeated Deleterius’ hordes and then let the dragon go.
<font color="#CC0000">Eurydice|</font> that goes agaijst pretty much every Animancer ideal I stand for
<font color="#CC0000">Eurydice|</font> we’re supposed to further society, slavery does more than bind the subjugated, it chains the slaver to an outmoded and untenable mentality, restricts the economy, and weakens the foundfation of civilization as a whole.
<font color="#CC0000">Eurydice|</font> what if the dragon rebels or breaks free?
<font color="#FF9900">MAYZEMASTER|</font> IT CAN’T, you have the scepter!
<font color="#CC0000">Eurydice|</font> what if we lose the scepter
<font color="#CC0000">Eurydice|</font> or someone TAKES it?
<font color="#FF9900">MAYZEMASTER|</font> I guess you’ll have to be careful, then!
<font color="#CC0000">Eurydice|</font> DESTROTYIN IT
<font color="#CC0000">Eurydice|</font> IS
<font color="#CC0000">Eurydice|</font> BEUJNFG CAREFYK!!!
<font color="#CC0000">Eurydice|</font> you know what I mean
<font color="#33CCCC">HULKULEEZ!|</font> You know, the more I think about the eventualities, however minute, the prospect of growing to rely upon this dragon seems less and less appealing...
<font color="#00FF00">Mell|</font> fine whatever I smash the stupid thing and loot Vextro’s corpse
<font color="#FF9900">MAYZEMASTER|</font> UGH now I’ve gotta rewrite part of my story! ------ I’ll let you know when I’m ready
