Evening love,

I know you're still mad, it's just — really, how often do I get to explain what pants are? Of COURSE I'll have a little fun and say you wear them on your arms. Honestly, it's like you've never heard of a practical joke before, which... On second thought, I suppose you actually haven't, being stuck on Akopos your whole life.

That's actually the reason I'm writing you. I was hoping I could plumb you for information about my people, specifically our life-cycles and why my scales are falling off like bloody parade confetti. Cheers!

We learned much from the Roa, but they shared very little about their own lives. I only came in contact with Elder Roa who had made their final transition long ago.

You were only supposed to be gone from Akopos for a few years. Maybe you're just becoming an old snake?

That's precisely what I'm worried about, love — I ain't keen on losing me limbs. Poncing around like a giant eel is all well and good on an ocean world, but we're in the middle of bloody space! I can't expect to keep business up if I can't even walk!

Your nanowhatzits — they can regenerate cells, right? Help a fellow sea buddy out.

The best I could hope to do is to stall the transition — I can't undo any progress it's already made. Have you shown any other symptoms yet?

Just the aforementioned scale-shedding, some mild joint pain, headaches, etc. Nothing too worrisome. It's probabsdfbdddd
