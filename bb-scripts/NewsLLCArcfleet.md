The Last Light Consortium (LLC) Arcfleet began out of necessity. After all, if the Varelsi are destroying every planet you set up manufacturing facilities on, it’s hardly cost effective.

With the universe going dark, mobilizing your workforce is necessary for peak efficiency (and survival).

Hundreds of years – and hundreds of thousands of ships – later, the LLC Arcfleet is a commercially-driven armada operating primarily to optimize profits, even in the face of certain extinction. While there are no celestial bodies attached to the LLC, their incredibly ornate Guildships signal the technological opulence valued throughout the LLC’s Arcfleet.

**An Interconnected Society**

The LLC has flourished as humans, Artificial Intelligences, and “augmented human hybrids” have figured out how to co-exist: their love of upgrading and improving technology. And profit. Lots of profit. So, with 3,800 Guildships and nearly 250,000 arcships in the fleet, the LLC rely upon a networked system of AIs collaborating to do everything from coordinating fleet travel to outputting new lines of sentry drones at Minion Robotics.

**Ports of Interest**

While there are entire Guildships loaded with inhabitants according to trade - artisans, lawyers, and accountants to name a few – there are a handful of exceptionally exquisite ships in the Arcfleet. Beyond the behemoths responsible for manufacturing drones for Minion Robotics, here are a few of the more notable ships:

<ul>
<li>**The Hemsworth Guildship** - Home of one of the oldest and most prestigious human-based dynasties in the LLC. The Hemsworth family owns a massive percentage of the manufacturing power of the LLC, including Minion Robotics. It is also the home of renowned adventurer and heir to the Hemsworth fortune, Phoebe.</li>
<li>**Drone Carrier Thrax** – While the AI Magnus, the Magna Carta, has been hard to pin down to one location, it has long been rumored that the entity is housed on a massive AI drone carrier which it uses to defend its interests.</li>
<li>**The Galactic Holo-Arena** – What do you do when you have time, money, and a nearly endless supply of combat robots? You FIGHT! And bet on the outcomes! Then find tax shelters to conceal any winnings! Any sentient being, robot or otherwise, is invited to participate in one-on-one combat in the Galactic Grand Championship which is broadcast live across the fleet (and to other subscribing faction stations) from a central Holo-Arena arcship. This is where the legendary El Dragón made a name for himself, as a human fighting all-robotic challengers. If anyone were to place bets and sell a pay-per-view live feed for the end of the universe – it’d likely happen right here.</li>
