(19959.16 C.R., transcript of secure-channel messaging between Captain Trevor Ghalt and Sister Ambra, retrieved from Nova’s archived records.)

<font color="#B2CC80">Sister Ambra,
I’m not really sure who else to go to about this, but uh, Attikus locked himself in the simulation chamber a while ago. I’d get Kleese to shut it down, but he said he’s busy modifying that Magnus we picked up for combat. Nova says that if we really want, she can “airlock” him out—why we have an airlock IN the simulation room, I’m sure I don’t know. Anyway, you’re kind of my last shot here.

<font color="#cc0000">Captain Ghalt,
Though my qualifications are both extensive and substantial, I fail to see how any of them apply to this situation. I am a Silent Sister of the Order of the Sustaining Mother, not a locksmith. Have you tried knocking?
-Sister Claudia Ambralia Divia</font>

<font color="#B2CC80">Ambra,
I know better than to get anywhere near Attikus when he’s…moody. But even from outside the room, I heard him roaring something about a Silent Sister named “Aria”, I think? I figured maybe being a Sister yourself; you might know what’s going on.
-Ghalt</font>

<font color="#cc0000">Trevor,
Aria is my sister, an Incantress Superior of the Order. It comes as no surprise that he is taking his time dealing with her. She can be quite insufferable. I expect he’ll tire of her shrewish face and shrill whining soon.
-Sister Claudia Ambralia Divia</font>

<font color="#B2CC80">Ambra,
I’m confused. When you say “sister”, do you mean a fellow Silent Sister, or a sibling?
-Ghalt</font>

<font color="#cc0000">Trevor,
Both.
-Ambra</font>

<font color="#B2CC80">Sister Ambra,
Did it not occur to you that there might be some tactical relevance to your having family within the Order? Why didn’t you ever mention her before? Is she dangerous?
-Ghalt</font>

<font color="#cc0000">Captain Ghalt,
“Family” is too warm a word for Aria. We haven’t been close for eleven thousand years, not since…the incident. I didn’t think my personal rivalry was germane to our objectives. And I feel I should hardly need remind you that EVERY Silent Sister is dangerous. But yes, Aria especially. She wears that GARISH modified assault frame, and is a practiced hand at pacifying Thrall. During the rebellions, we emphasized non-lethal suppression tactics. Standard procedure was to just drop shock anchors until they calmed down.
-Ambra</font>

<font color="#B2CC80">Ambra,
That sounds really NOT non-lethal.
-Ghalt</font>

<font color="#cc0000">Trevor,
Yes, well, there was “emphasis”, not “exclusivity”. Besides, it’s good for the survivors. Toughens them up. Builds character. Establishes a regular heart rhythm.
-Ambra</font>

<font color="#B2CC80">Sister Ambra,
He’s been in there for days.
-Ghalt</font>

<font color="#cc0000">Captain Ghalt,
Perhaps I should intercede more directly…I’ll see what I can do.
-Sister Claudia Ambralia Divia</font>
