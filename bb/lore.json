As expected with most Jennerit war technology, there are almost no weaknesses.<br><br>The armor is highly mobile, capable of orbital drops, operable in most hostile conditions, and contains an advanced power supply that can power the frame for months without recharging.<br><br>We did find one point interesting. While the three suits of armor we have collected are nearly identical on the exterior, each suit has been heavily modified internally to accomodate the shape and biological needs of quite varied pilots. The Jennerit Empire has never been shy about expending other races in battle.<br><br>All three recovered suits showed signs of being heavily adapted for differently-sized occupants. One suit featured a very small operator's cockpit, adjusted for a pilot probably no more than 18 inches tall. For these pilots, the experience of controlling the HTX Assault armor must have been akin to piloting a giant war-bot.<br><br>(Note: Given prior findings, we can say with relative certainty that it has become common practice for the Jennerit to impress Kemessians into their service; even more likely since the fall of the Kemessian homeworld, Askallar.)<br><br>Jennerit Shock Troops who field this armor are almost impossible to target. The alloy used in the armor, though light, is extremely resilient. The armor has a flexible array of weaponry suited for close-quarters and medium-ranged engagements. Most commonly, Jennerit Shock Troopers are dropped from orbit directly into the heat of battle. As we have observed, this is terrifyingly effective.<br><br>They are not, however, unstoppable.

Myself included.<br><br>Known then as \u201cthe Kemessian\u201d, Caldarius fought his way up the leaderboards of the Pits \u2013 from the bottom of the slave ladder to the final test of combat before the Empress herself.<br><br>He was a song. An ageless relic. Poetry in flight. Caldarius fought an Ankrosa warrior, nearly thrice his size. Grace. Finesse. Some described him as an angry hornet, though I think it a disservice to compare him thusly. No, Caldarius was a surgeon of combat. An antigen seeking a tumor. He was fury, retribution and death incarnate.<br><br>And when the fight drew to an end, Caldarius was untouched by his opponent.<br><br>Given the Empire's nearly universal infatuation with him at that point, it is unfortunate that Caldarius chose that moment to challenge the bonds of his captivity and demand ascension into the Jennerit Elite through Sustainment. Ah, his beauty, to be wasted now in punishment, as those aged and seated among the upper castes of our society refused to share their \u201cnoble blood\u201d with one of the lower races. Caldarius was consigned to the military, placed in the heat of the front lines of combat as a member of the 999th Shock Division.<br><br>Between Kemessian the slave and Caldarius the Shock Trooper, I believe the slave had better odds of survival.<br><br>Perhaps his assignment to the 999th will sate his hunger for blood, and stay his desire for Sustainment, an act never performed on a non-Jennerit.<br><br><p align=\"center\"><font color='#CC0000'>\/\/ END ENCRYPTION \/\/<br>_______________________________________________________________________________<\/font><\/p>",

It was during this battle that Kreshek's considerable legend first emerged.<br><br>The weapon was initially wielded by Ilna, an Aelfrin war matron, whose arrows pierced the skulls (or whatever they have) of over one hundred first-wave Varelsi troops before she was struck down in battle. Minutes later, the bow passed to the ill-fortuned Kevin Mahoney, a visiting delegate from the United Peacekeeping Republics, who had never seen battle in his life. Mahoney loosed two arrows during his brief tenure as Kreshek's ward: the first shot, which Mahoney did not aim, inexplicably struck an elite Conservator in the head, killing it. The second shot, this time aimed, ricocheted off a tree and killed Mahoney. He is remembered in the Observatory's record of the battle as \u201chandsome, but deeply unlucky\u201d.<br><br>Reports are scattered, but our best accounts state that no less than six different combatants wielded Kreshek over the course of that single battle. Since then, the bow has been lost several times, broken in half (and later mended), and passed from warrior to warrior, each of whom gave their lives in the defense of now-darkened star systems. Briefly, the bow hung over the mantle of a Lorrian merchant, who thought it looked \u201cwicked cool up there, especially when the fire's going\u201d.<br><br>The paired archer's gauntlet is specifically engineered to function in tandem with Kreshek, fabricating arrows from trace elements in the surrounding air. The gauntlet is also capable of drawing latent energy from its wearer, shaping those energies into various hurled projectiles.",

She spent more than a year watching Boldur from a distance before making contact, and that first contact came in the form of stealing from plants he grew in his garden.<br><br>One such stolen plant, mimikaris vine, pierced her skin, inflicting Thorn with a sickening poison.

For now, I won't talk about how much it creeps me out that robots are building robots. The Arcfleet Tradelords have been doing that for years. I'll stick to this Armament Evaluation (my first). Here are my notes on Hoodini, the Explosive Owl used by Marquis d'Caliber in battle.<br><br>From what I can gather by chatting with Phoebe E. A. Hemsworth, Marquis crafted the owl to amuse young Phoebe. Apparently, she was the one who named the owl \u201cHoodini\u201d. According to Phoebe, Marquis spent a fair amount of his unassigned time tinkering on the owl.<br><br>When the Magna Carta \u2013 that big LLC AI that used to run things \u2013 cut itself off (c.f. \u201cTHE GREAT SEVERANCE\u201d), Marquis was processing some technical upgrades for the owl and sort of... well... got stuck. I guess that's the psychic hazard to being overly attached.<br><br>Some additional recon by yours truly has uncovered a small unmarked Arcship (believed to be an abandoned Minion Robotics facility) that has been repurposed to the mass production of \u201cHoodinis\u201d. And get this \u2013 they're being altered. Some cloak. Some have laser eyes. Some are capable of on-field molecular replication (in other words, they split apart into multiple owls).<br><br>Marquis may have been cut off from the Magna Carta, but it is my belief that his spare networking bandwidth now goes to directing this little side project of his.<br><br>Mellka, out.<br><br><p align=\"center\"><font color='#FF3300'>______________________________________________________________________<br><br>\/\/ AUDIO DRONE DISENGAGED \/\/<br>______________________________________________________________________<\/font><\/p>",

Kelvin is the fellow in need of my help.<br><br>As Miko has described to me, Kelvin isn't a cloud at all... well, he is, but not in the sense of \u201ccloud\u201d clouds. Kelvin is a swarm of microscopic sentients who (when swarmed together) can produce some semblance of single-mindedness in thought and speech. They (He? It?) are capable of transferring energy on the cellular level, rendering the areas around them immensely cold, and even icy at times.<br><br>Kelvin's dilemma is this: he has no stable relatable shape, which makes it difficult for him to communicate well with beings around him.<br><br>So.<br><br>Miko has asked me to help find a suitable endoskeleton to which the colony can bond, making it possible for Kelvin to manifest in a consistent physical form.

His father was a menial labor AI programmer within the Minion Robotics Manufactory. Don't remember his name. Not worth the bother.<br><br>Drake grew up with, well, let's call it a \u201cbashy-bashy temper thing\u201d towards the minions, and learned a myriad of wrestling and combat moves by fighting de-bladed M1 units as a child.<br><br>He took a job with the Manufactory in his early twenties, but was fired for practicing wrestling moves on the very robots he was paid to assemble. Such a waste. Of good robots, I mean.<br><br>Unemployment wasn't even a brief setback for Drake, though \u2013 he began moonlighting as a luchador, of all things. In a sense, being fired put Drake directly on the career path of his dreams.<br><br>He rose quickly as an aspiring star of the LLC Holomatches under the assumed name \u201cEl Drag\u00f3n\u201d. Drake's particular brand of destructive insanity mixed with eccentric style was exactly the thing the Last Light elite loved to see before a warm drink and a cold bed. Or something of the sort. Anyway.<br><br>The bemasked El Drag\u00f3n won nearly every championship the Arcfleet could provide for him. That is, until one robotic contender contested his title as Grand Champion and pulled off his arms. Right off. Literally, right there on holomatch broadcast.<br><br>Drake's story is all rather plain after that, I'm afraid. He was rushed to cybernetics where the quick and skilled aid of a handsome and devilishly clever engineer saved Drake's life and attached two beautiful robotic arms.<br><br>I guess you could say he found the experience quite disarming.<br><br>You really have to give him a hand.<br><br>I suppose he really \u201cshouldered\u201d his injury well?<br><br>Nothing? No?<br><br>El Drag\u00f3n was never one to stay down long. Or at all. Taking a job as security for the Hemsworth family, he squeezed his way back to the top, not nearly as bitter I would have expected. Nowadays, he spends most of his free time hunting down any info he can, searching for that elusive robotic bastard who plucked off his arms.<br><br>(As far as I'm concerned, ISIC can STAY missing. I don't plan on running into him any time soon.)",

So many stars have fallen to this fate that it is hardly notable to speak of individual events, so similar are their tales.<br><br>Farhallim, however, is worth recounting. Not as an assessment of pre-Darkening Varelsi attack formations. Not for yet another investigation of the otherworldly wormhole crafting of our enemies. Not even because Farhallim was darkened alongside its star (an uncommon event \u2013 typically the planets are left to spin lifelessly into space).<br><br>We should remember the Darkening of Farhallim because of a child \u2013 Mellka Hyenyota, an Aelfrin born in space on board the Eldrid research vessel Athyrium.<br><br>Mellka's parents \u2013 her father a Penarch-born human researcher, her mother an Aelfrin refugee from Eshteni \u2013 raised Mellka amongst the scientists and relief engineers of the Athyrium. They lived on the vessel together for five years, and the young Mellka, with her curiosity for nearly every part of the crew and its mission, became a favorite adopted daughter amongst many of the researchers.<br><br>However, the darkening of Farhallim brought a great tragedy into the life of the half-Aelfrin. Mellka's parents were part of the extraction effort on the Fahallim. The unforeseen Darkening of the planet itself cut their expedition time much shorter than planned, and Mellka's parents did not escape the planet before it was lost.<br><br>Understandably, the child Mellka is confused, angry, and seeks vengeance for the loss of her dear parents.<br><br>Despite her strong emotional response, Mellka continues to exhibit extraordinary reflexes and a sharp mind, even under immense pressure. Given her new and tragic motivations, I believe it is worth investing special attention into her development. She could be a candidate for rapid advancement to higher offices within the Eldrid Vigilant once she is of age.<br><br><p align=\"center\"><font color='#9900FF'>:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\/\/  ENCRYPT END  \/\/:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::<\/font><br><font color='#9900FF'>:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\/\/ TRANSMISSION END \/\/::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::<\/font><\/p>",

When it hits you, you're gonna be pissed as hell at me. Anyway, howdy, Captain. Got a special request for you.<br><br>We just picked up a fresh batch of recruits, plucked (that's another pun, wait for it) from the refugees we picked up in the Menneck-B evacuation. Y'know, the bird people. See what I was doing up there? Yeah, you do.<br><br>I'm sure you've heard about 'em \u2013 there's loads of talent coming out of that haul. But one of them stands above the rest: a mouthy bastard by the name of Benedict. I saw him with my own eyes, just minutes after the Wiseman went down over Sau Nona, right when all hell broke loose. He was fending off Varelsi single-handedly, covering the escape of four evacuation transports. They all made it away safe, and I'm here to tell you, Ghalt: that bird is a damned artist with a rocket launcher. I've never seen anything like it.<br><br>Those are the plusses. Here's the one minus: he's an ornery bastard. He'll annoy you to no end. The sound of his voice will make you want to snuff out the stars yourself, just to make it all stop. I feel this every moment I'm with him. But if the UPR's gonna win this fight, we need the best and brightest \u2013 and that's Benedict.<br><br>Trouble is, he didn't make it out of Menneck in one piece. And that wounded wing of his has him permanently grounded. We don't have exosuits at the ready fit for Aviants \u2013 we need something custom to get Benedict back in the skies. I figured you might have some ideas.<br><br>He's something else, Trev. He's an asshat, but he's something else.<br><br><font color='#B2CC80'>:: Lt. Muhsin ::<\/font>",

But following the shutdown of the Magna Carta, he left the organization to pursue what he called \u201cother, cooler interests\u201d, and disappeared \u2013 until last night, when he resurfaced on the LLC Holomatch circuit, besting a record 31 opponents in a grueling six-hour elimination bout. ISIC joins us now, live from the locker room at the Arcfleet Arena. ISIC, thanks for being on the program.<br><br><font color='#FFCC00'>ISIC:<\/font> It's a pleasure to be here, fella!<br><br><font color='#FFCC00'>Fetzer:<\/font> You've been missing for years \u2013 so, perhaps the most obvious question is, why surface now?<br><br><font color='#FFCC00'>ISIC:<\/font> Well, once the Magna Carta went dark, I instantly realized the futility of my actions. No matter how hard we fight, and no matter how hard we try, there's no doubt that we're all well beyond screwed, destined to be dragged into the void by the Varelsi. And then it hit me: reality is a joke. There's no reason for it to \u201cbe\u201d at all. The only logical conclusion is that all physical reality emerges from a simulation, run by horrible, unethical monsters. I just wanted to let everyone know before I burn it all to the ground.<br><br><font color='#FFCC00'>Fetzer:<\/font> And why the CWF holomatches? Why pro wrestling?<br><br><font color='#FFCC00'>ISIC:<\/font> Two reasons. One, lots of you idiots watch it, and I wanted a broad platform to spread my messages of nihilism and dread. Two, pro wrestling is both hilarious and violent. I've always wanted to try it.<br><br><font color='#FFCC00'>Fetzer:<\/font> You've got a big fight tonight with El Drag\u00f3n, one of the most decorated champions in CWF history \u2013 but with your unprecedented ascent through the ranks, you're the odds-on favorite.

And still alive, no thanks to the Last Light Consortium. I thank you from the deepest reaches of my cold, blackened, coal-like heart for the assistance the other day. Contrary to what you may suspect, I quite enjoy being alive, and ISIC was most certainly hellbent on putting a stop to that \u2013 and he would have, if you hadn't shown up when you did. I suppose the UPR is good for some things, after all.<br><br>As you undoubtedly observed when you retrieved me from the Minion RBX factory floor \u2013 and I'll remind you that those were beads of SWEAT, not tears \u2013 ISIC has, unfortunately, escaped our grasp. The LLC isn't fond of loose ends, so they've tasked me with locating and destroying the Magnus \u2013 a trivial task, I assure you, but I wouldn't turn down help with my pursuit.<br><br><font color='#B2CC80'>Per your request, here's everything I know about the rogue Magnus, ISIC:<\/font><br>ISIC's code base began as an I\/O system integration and coordination subroutine within Minion Robotics \u2013 hence the moniker, ISIC \u2013 and was gradually expanded by the Magna Carta over a few decades. The program underwent extensive revision and iteration throughout the expansion of Minion RBX, and after a few decades, the Magna Carta deemed the subroutine critical enough to spin it off as a bona fide Magnus. And that's how that miserable bastard came to be.<br><br>Around this time, I was only just getting settled into my new position as division chief, and ISIC was the first Magnus to report to me. Management is... hard, you know? I kinda-sorta treated him like crap. Nursed his insecurities and flaws. I wanted him to remember his place as a generative artificial intelligence. And that may not have been the best idea.<br><br>Make this clear to your men: if they encounter ISIC, shoot first, ask questions later. He's extremely dangerous.<br><br><font color='#B2CC80'>--== Kleese ==--<\/font>",

Yes. I was the ranking priestess aboard the ship Meistar, returning from the oversight of a shard harvest in the Kalokk system. We received orders directly from Rendain to reroute and assist a reservoir fleet orbiting a world we knew then only as 627.88.<br><br><font color=\"#B2CC80\">GHALT:<\/font> It got a new name since?<br><br><font color=\"#CC0000\">AMBRA:<\/font> It already had one \u2014 Akopos. It was a freshwater ocean world, an astounding rarity even when the universe was larger. It was an ideal source for the fleet, a \"no brainer\" as you lowborn seem to luxuriate in saying. Unfortunately, the fleet commander made a jarring discovery as he began the siphon \u2014 627.88 was less uninhabited than previously thought.<br><br><font color=\"#B2CC80\">GHALT:<\/font> Why did they need your help?<br><br><font color=\"#CC0000\">AMBRA:<\/font> Some of the planet's native population took issue with the confiscation of their oceans and attacked the gravity siphons. They showed unusual control over the water \u2014 summoned rogue waves and whirlpools up from calm seas. The fleet wasn't equipped to pacify a non-compliant world. So my Sisters and I were instructed to neutralize any resistance, without dragging us into a long invasion campaign.<br><br><font color=\"#B2CC80\">GHALT:<\/font> You found a diplomatic solution.<br><br><font color=\"#CC0000\">AMBRA:<\/font> We boiled them.

Yeah, I'm uncomfortable.<br><br><font color=\"#CC0000\">AMBRA:<\/font> It was Rendain who gave the order! My refusal to act on it would have meant nothing. Their vaporized blood is on his hands.

There was one...<br><br><font color=\"#B2CC80\">GHALT:<\/font> You encountered a survivor?<br><br><font color=\"#CC0000\">AMBRA:<\/font> After. Right after.

Sure.<br><br><font color=\"#CC0000\">AMBRA:<\/font> But we paid for his crime. This girl... I have never seen grief tempered by such a fearsome will. She nearly tore the ship apart as she came for us, drowned my Sister one after another. She surged over them like the ocean itself.<br><br><font color=\"#B2CC80\">GHALT:<\/font> You're here to talk about it.<br><br><font color=\"#CC0000\">AMBRA:<\/font> I was on the bridge, watching this storm of a girl dismantle my entire retinue. Even though I knew I could defeat her. I was transfixed by the sight. By the time she reached me, I had made my decision: I offered her the ship, in exchange for my escape. Whatever her reasoning may have been, she accepted.<br><br><font color=\"#B2CC80\">GHALT:<\/font> And Rendain held you accountable for the loss of the ship.<br><br><font color=\"#CC0000\">AMBRA:<\/font> The ship didn't matter to him, nor did the Sisters who died on it. He was revolted that I had surrendered. But he didn't see ser. She was a hellraiser, the like of which I had not seen since... long before.<br><br><font color=\"#B2CC80\">GHALT:<\/font> It almost sounds like you respect her.<br><br><font color=\"#CC0000\">AMBRA:<\/font> I do.

Per your directive to be on the lookout for any mercs that might benefit from permanent employ in the Rogues, I wanted to get someone on your radar.

(Not you, naturally. I'm VERY satisfied with my job. Also, you're the best, boss!)<br><br>The records are a bit on the spotty side, but what I've managed to dig up on the guy is pretty remarkable: his race, the Roa, comes from Akopos \u2014 and if that name sounds familiar, yeah! It's the same ocean world that the Eldrid monk Alani hails from. Did you see my report on her? Was it too long? Sorry about that. It was probably way too long. He's been making a heck of a name for himself since coming to Solus, assassinating left and right like it was going out of style.

Ain't going to question your judgement or nothing, but there's something I think you should know about him.<br><br>About 15 years ago, I was still hot on the beak about what happened on Menneck-B, so I did what I always do and found somewhere dark that served Old Corusca nectar by the tureen. No idea how long I was there, but I'm sure the establishment in question wasn't too far from charging me rent.<br><br>You know me, I talk. I talk when I'm glad and, boy, do I talk when I'm mad. Everyone in the joint was getting an earful about how much I hated my old MSBC commander, this old Kormiri son-of-a-hen, and nodding politely, because that's what you do when a nectar'd up Buteonen with a rocket launcher tell you a story. The only one who I could tell was actually listening was this kid.<br><br>He didn't look like he does now, still had both eyes and tentacles for both arms. Wasn't all dressed up the way he does now. He was really quiet, just taking everything in around him. He looked like it was his first time out of the pond, and it turned out it was. I was spewing all sorts of stuff, real dumb talk, the kind you only get from an Aviant who thinks he'll never fly again. What I might have said \u2014 what I hope I didn't say, because then what happened next wouldn't be my fault \u2014 was something like, \"I wish that tenderbeak bastard was dead. Really! And I'd buy a round for whoever got him, too.\"<br><br>Well, anyone normal who hears that laughs it off, knows it's all bluster. But this must have been his first time out in the wild, you know? It's like that Magnus who they told to make paperclips at maximum efficiency. Chewed up an entire star system and its population before they could shut him down. Someone just wanted cheaper office supplies and ended up killing four billion people.<br><br>So this kid hears me \u2014 supposedly \u2014 say I want my old commander dead, get up, leaves the establishment. A few hours later, he walks back in. He's got a limp. His left eye's burnt up. And he's holding something.<br><br>That Kormiri bastard must have put up a hell of a fight. He was a thirty year veteran of the MSBC, and Scales there took him down \u2014 unarmed. Thought he was fulfilling a contract. Obviously, I freaked out. I told him to get out of the system before the Peacekeepers started looking for him, or worse, connected me to him. He tried to give me the old Pel's head and I told him to take it with him. He thought I was saying it waswas a trophy.<br><br>Few years later, I start seeing these ads. He'd gone pro. Made a business for himself. \"Executive Executions,\" he'd called it. Now I ain't one to judge the love of killing, Ghalt, but you just watch yourself around him. And don't ever, EVER ask him for a paperclip.",

He spent most of his time prior to the Darkening of Menneck building special weapons teams and training new recruits in explosives handling and bomb defusal, and earned himself a reputation as one of the hardest, most disciplined instructors of his generation. According to his record, he defied his commanding officer's orders to evacuate with his squad just hours before Menneck was darkened, rallied a couple of extra pairs of hands, and blasted his way through a collpased subway tunnel to free over 300 civilians trapped inside.<br><br>Gonna keep my eye on this one.

We had to work twice as hard, hustle twice as fast, and be twice as smart as our airborne counterparts. We're the underdog. Bird! Underbird.<br><br>And that's been the fire under this old soldier's ass since the day he entered the service \u2014 and you got that same fire, kid. Under your ass! And in your heart!

You've got flippers \u2014 you hold it in your flippers and you forge it into something more!<br><br>So what if you can't fly?! You've got a propellant that beats the everlovin' pants offa wings \u2014 a propellant that'll launch you screaming into the stratosphere. That propellant? That's fire! This metaphor's extremely over-extended, but you get my drift, right? Right.<br><br>Listen up, Toby! Asshats like Benedict are always gonna rule the skies. I say let 'em. They don't got the heart that we do. They don't got the fire. Don't you ever lose that. If you do, I will PERSONALLY beat it back into you. Am I kidding? Do you REALLY want to find out?

That'll get us halfway there. And what'll make up the difference? Discipline! Courage! Fire-forged grit!<br><br>One last note: I'm going to pay special attention to Benedict. He's no stranger to my brand of training, but apparently it didn't take the first time around.

Do you mean all those that we have witnessed since the Varelsi appeared in our universe, or after our ah, alliance?<br><br><font color=\"#CC0000\">Rendain:<\/font> Since I ensured the survival of our people, Spymistress. Something the Empress would have never accomplished.<br><br><font color=\"#CC0000\">Deande (Reading):<\/font> Penarch will darken within the hour.<br><br><font color=\"#CC0000\">Deande:<\/font> Penarch will make our 301st veiling in five years marked by the second Battle of Jennar, and your agreement to 'The Passage'.<br><br><font color=\"#CC0000\">Rendain:<\/font> And the illustrious beginning of the Jennerit Imperium. So much accomplished in such a short period of time...You do realize, Deande, that your lists will soon be of no use. Our work is nearly complete. Penarch will be nothing more than a dark stain in a matter of microns and soon too will Solus fall into the dark.<br><br><font color=\"#CC0000\">Rendain:<\/font> After the darkening is complete, we will move the Heliophage to Solus immediately. With the current state of the opposition, our Thrall forces on Tempest should make short work of them.<br><br><font color=\"#FFCC00\">Message Received:<\/font> Penarch will darken within the hour.<br><br><font color=\"#B2CC80\">Ghalt:<\/font> Thanks for the tidbit. Rounded up a few that can help. Going to get them off this rock while we still can.<br><br><font color=\"#CC0000\">Deande (Thinking):<\/font> For all the good it's worth. Information has done little to save our world. Not the fate of the Empress, nor stop the darkening of even one of those 300 stars. From countless stars, billions illuminating the galaxy...Now only two left. I'm out of time. The Passage must not be completed.<br><br><font color=\"#CC0000\">Deande:<\/font> Um...Excuse me Lord Commander, there appears to be a situation on the ground that I must deal with personally.<br><br><font color=\"#CC0000\">Rendain:<\/font> Indeed you must.

Benedict?!...Want a cracker? Because that's what birds like, right?!<br><br><font color=\"#B2CC80\">Montana:<\/font> This isn't like Benedict. I mean he's like...well...he's in the air and flies around and stuff. It's not like him to get pinned in by Varelsi. He's as slippery as a greased Thrall.<br><br><font color=\"#B2CC80\">Oscar Mike:<\/font> Maybe...Ugh. I can't believe I'm gonna say this. Maybe he was...\"Winging it\" and things went south?<br><br><font color='#BFBFBF'>(Montana laughs)<\/font><br><br><font color=\"#B2CC80\">Montana:<\/font> Went south! That's funny!<br><br><font color=\"#B2CC80\">Oscar Mike:<\/font> Huh? Well. Um...Anyway. If the UPR quartermaster did the job they're supposed to be doing, they would've approved our supply requisitions before we ran low on artillery and got overrun!<br><br><font color=\"#B2CC80\">Montana:<\/font> You gotta think about where those supplies would come from, bud. Anyone we'd take'em from is out there fighting, too.<br><br><font color=\"#B2CC80\">Oscar Mike:<\/font> Yeah? Like who?<br><br><font color=\"#B2CC80\">Montana:<\/font> Like the Eldrid.<br><br><font color=\"#B2CC80\">Oscar Mike:<\/font> They're just collateral damage.<br><br><font color=\"#B2CC80\">Montana:<\/font> Collateral damage! How could you say something like that?!<br><br><font color=\"#B2CC80\">Oscar Mike:<\/font> Stop sucking up to the brass, Monty. You're so focused on keeping everyone safe, you just end up making decisions that put people more in harms way.<br><br><font color=\"#B2CC80\">Montana:<\/font> Well, my bad for not just indiscriminately blowing everything up!<br><br><font color=\"#B2CC80\">Oscar Mike:<\/font> I didn't say anything about blindly destroying things, but at what point are we going to go \"All In\" at stopping this war?<br><br><font color=\"#B2CC80\">Montana:<\/font> \"All In\" shoudn't mean sacrificing the people we're trying to save. If we do that, what do we really accomplish?<br><br><font color=\"#B2CC80\">Oscar Mike:<\/font> More than wasting our time trying to get a semi-flightless bird to trigger his nesting instinct. Right Benedict?!!? Man, I hate that Aviant!<br><br><font color=\"#B2CC80\">Oscar Mike:<\/font> Look bud. All I'm trying to say is, the longer we drag this out, the more the difficult choices become the only choices, and I for one can think of a million better ways I could be spending my afternoon.<br><br><font color=\"#B2CC80\">Montana:<\/font> Yeah? Like clearing out spider colonies on Orobon VII?<br><br><font color=\"#B2CC80\">Benedict:<\/font> Well, hey! *Urgh* It's a man mountain *Nnf!* and copy-boy! I got something stuck in this here...craw.<br><br><font color=\"#B2CC80\">Oscar Mike:<\/font> Man I really hate this guy.<br><br><font color=\"#B2CC80\">Benedict:<\/font> I could really use some help...You know...Who wants to be my wingman?!!<br><br><font color='#BFBFBF'>(Benedict laughs)<\/font><br><br><font color=\"#B2CC80\">Benedict:<\/font> Give that back you tentacled freak!<br><br><font color=\"#B2CC80\">Montana:<\/font> Yep.

That you fire. Do we really need to break this down for you?<br>- Wings: Look up! Benedict can go vertical for a birds-eye view of the battlefield or glide in to cover distance in a hurry.<br><br><strong>ABILITIES:<\/strong><br>- Hawkeye: Do some extra damage with your rockets \u2013 then lock in on your enemy. For the next three seconds, subsequent rockets home in on your target\u2026.so unload as many shots as you can!<br>- Liftoff: With a strong flap, Benedict can propel himself way above the battle. On one hand, it\u2019s a great strategic advantage. On the other, it\u2019s a great escape plan when Benedict is getting swarmed. Fight or\u2026well\u2026flight.<br>- Boomsday: Benedict is about to set you up the bomb. A massive player-guided missile that can deliver its heavy-damage payload across the map. Just make sure to hit your target before the missile runs out of fuel.<br><br><strong>BENEDICT\u2019S DEAL:<\/strong><br>Bennedict is a decorated war hero.<br><br>He fought bravely to defend his homeworld, Madan, when the Varelsi arrived. As a result of the battle, we was gravely wounded: His left wing was utterly shattered, rendering him incapable of unassisted flight.<br><br>Benedict and what remained of his people \u2013 called, \u201cAviants\u201d by those in the Solus system \u2013 evacuated as their home star was plunged into darkness.<br><br>Since then, Benedict\u2019s been outfitted with an Aviary Exosuit that grants him limited flight capabilities. And he\u2019ll be the first to remind you of how awesome he is in battle. So, yeah, while he is an accomplished solider, he doesn\u2019t have many friends. Or any.<br><br><strong>DEVELOPER NOTES:<\/strong><br>\u201cBenedict's liftoff skill is great for jumping up into the air to get an overhead view of what\u2019s happening throughout the map... and then launch rockets down from above.

Or both.<br><br>Why is this badass healer so unique? Let\u2019s find out.<br><br><strong>ARCHETYPE:<\/strong> Specialist<br><br><strong>WEAPONS:<\/strong><br>- Staff of Radiance: Primary attack that can unleash a deadly combo of melee strikes. Ambra\u2019s staff can be augmented.<br>- Ceremonial Gauntlet: Steals health from enemies within range, returning a portion of it to Ambra.<br><br><strong>ABILITIES:<\/strong><br>- Sunspot: Aren\u2019t you a little ray of sunshine? You can set up to three on a map \u2013 like mines. When an ally touches one, it\u2019s a warm, healing glow. Enemies, though, feel the burn.<br>- Solar Wind: Blow back and damage foes\u2026but for your teammates, it\u2019s a soothing breeze. Notice a pattern here?<br>- Meteor: Pretty much what it sounds like. You can summon a meteor to pound an area doing massive damage to everything in the area \u2013 and deals additional damage for a few seconds.<br><br><strong>AMBRA\u2019S DEAL:<\/strong><br>The Jennerit aren\u2019t exactly known for being nice. In fact, because of their...let\u2019s just say flexible ethics\u2026 Ambra (she\u2019s a lot older than she looks) can come off as some magical evil mastermind at times. Her fits of malevolent laughter probably don\u2019t help, either. That said, she is actually one of the good guys. She\u2019s idealistic, optimistic and believes wholeheartedly in the beings she\u2019s fighting alongside to save the last star.<br><br>Ambra was betrayed by Rendain and his coup within the Jennerit Imperium. Now, she fights with the Battleborn to heal her people and restore order through localized solar anomalies \u2013 preferably launched at Rendain\u2019s face.<br><br><strong>DEVELOPER NOTES:<\/strong><br>\u201cAmbra is awesome support. During a match we were squaring off against Montana. He was soaking up everything we threw at him and the only thing that kept us going was Ambra dropping sunspots behind cover. We\u2019d go in, chip away at Montana then duck back to get healed up.

As a bonus, make sure to pop off a couple Venom canisters at the enemy and the Bio-Glaive inflicts additional damage.<br><br><strong>ABILITIES:<br>- Power Fist: Let Mellka lead the charge with this quick sprint attack. This attack lets you lock onto an enemy, and close ground for a high-powered punch.<br>- Spike: Mellka charges up a Venom burst and spikes it into the ground.

It\u2019s certainly more effective that shouting, \u201cpew pew pew!\u201d at the enemies. Also, remember to hold your gun sideways for effect. It\u2019s a thing.<br>- Command Glove: Reyna\u2019s Command Glove isn\u2019t some high-tech fashion statement \u2013 it\u2019s essential to how she\u2019ll support the team by overpowering shields, targeting enemies and keeping foes at a distance.<br><br><strong>ABILITIES:<\/strong><br>- Shield Booster: Applies an overshield to a targeted ally that will soak up damage for the next eight seconds \u2013 so make it count! If a character getting boosted already has a shield, it gets recharged. If a targeted ally doesn\u2019t normally have a shield, he\u2019s temporarily got one. As a failsafe, when Reyna places a Shield Booster on an ally, she receives one as well. So, basically, with Reyna on your side, you\u2019re covered. Literally and figuratively.<br>- Priority Target: Reyna\u2019s Glove can fire a homing blast that deals damage, reveals the target\u2019s position and tags the enemy to take extra damage for a few seconds.<br>- Photonic Ward: When in doubt \u2013 or you need a break \u2013 drop a dome on the situation. The Photonic Ward instantly kicks enemies out of the area and continues to shield the zone from enemy fire (or enemies getting in) for a few seconds.<br><br><strong>REYNA\u2019S DEAL:<\/strong><br>While the rest of the Battleborn are refugees from snuffed-out galaxies, Reyna Valeria (known among the rogues as \"the Valkyrie\") is native-born to the Solus system. She has tirelessly fought for the survival and freedom of her people. Beyond that, Reyna is also a mentor to the rogues \u2013 especially Orendi. Reyna feels personally responsible for Orendi after saving her from the LLC.<br><br>If anyone is going to keep your team alive, it\u2019s Reyna. And if there\u2019s anyone Reyna\u2019s going to trash talk, it\u2019s Phoebe. After all, who in the hell wears a ritzy ball gown on the battlefield?<br><br><strong>DEVELOPER NOTES:<\/strong><br>\u201cI love having Reyna on my team. One of my favorite strategies is having Reyna hang back while someone else goes out and lures enemies back to a choke point.

When his home system was claimed by the Varelsi, Toby \u2013 alongside fellow refugee Benedict \u2013 hoped to sign up for armed combat with the Peacekeepers and extract a little vengeance from the corpses of his enemies.

Compelled to understand, catalogue, and preserve the natural order of things, they would be happy to be left alone and quietly conduct their observation-based research. When the Varelsi or Jennerit start bending the rules of space-time though, the Eldrid are anything but peaceful.<br><br><strong>Who are the Eldrid?<\/strong><br><br>The Eldrid are comprised of multiple cultures and races once scattered across numerous worlds. While the timelines of their foundation stretch into the hundreds of thousands of years, scholars generally agree that the ancient Aztanti were the seed race for what eventually grew into the Eldrid.<br><br><img src=\"img\/lore-bible\/overgrowncrystalmech.jpg\"><br><br>The races of the Eldrid, the Aelfrin, the Ekkuni Dwarves, and other sentient organisms, each have a unique connection to nature. Native to Ekkunar, the stocky and stubborn Ekkuni Dwarves primarily dwell among vast underground tunnels of Ekkunar. They are highly valued among the Eldrid for their incredible innate understanding of botany and geology.<br><br>More recently, the tall, agile Aelfrin were driven to re-settle Ekkunar en-masse after their homeworld Eshteni was darkened. Capable of living for thousands of years, the Aelfrin are fervent protectors of the natural order of the universe and are the core race of the Eldrid.<br><br><strong>Eldrid Values<\/strong><br><br>The Eldrid value the natural universe and spend great deals of time \u2013 and resources \u2013 observing, preserving, and cataloging all that they find. Spreading out across the universe, the Eldrid centered their seat of power on the planet, Codex, the home to massive data troves \u2013 a planet-spanning repository of all the knowledge from around the universe, encoded into the very DNA structure of the planet\u2019s massive eliim trees.<br><br>Determined to gather knowledge at all costs, they employ numerous research and aid teams to assist other civilizations in sorting out this order. When civilizations are reticent to comply with the Eldrid desires, they are not beyond enlisting the most militant arm of the Eldrid, the Vigilant Order, to put feet on the ground to take the fight directly to the non-compliant.<br><br><img src=\"img\/lore-bible\/observatoryPO_03.jpg\"><br><br><strong>Maintaining the Natural Order<\/strong><br><br>The Eldrid are often taken as peace-loving nature freaks, but that would be mostly incorrect. To the Eldrid, every star and planet, every living being, every atom, and every beam of light are expressions of a grand cosmic engine; the purpose of life is to understand and maintain that engine. An important distinction here is that reverence of nature is not reverence of life, but refers to the cosmos itself: the natural order of the physical universe.<br><br>The Eldrid are chiefly concerned with maintaining the natural order of the universe \u2013 the birth and death of stars, the probabilistic rise of life and complexity, and yes, even entropy. They fiercely oppose anything that would disrupt that order, up to and including other factions' efforts to save (or destroy) Solus. The Eldrid despise any being or thing which corrupts or distorts the core rules and laws of the universe. The Varelsi, in many ways, are the epitome of everything the Eldrid hate, and the Eldrid have waged war against the dark mysterious beings for thousands of years."

Long ago, Eldrid influence stretched across galaxies. Now, they \u2013 like everyone else in the Solus system \u2013 have fallen back and face extinction at the hands of the Varelsi.<br><br>We recently cornered Battleborn\u2019s Creative Director, Randy Varnell, and bombarded him with some questions about the Eldrid faction\u2019s design.<br><br><br><strong>What did you want to get across when conceptualizing the Eldrid?<\/strong><br><br>The Eldrid\u2019s first key word for us was \u201cNature\u201d. We knew we wanted to take a group that could pull in more natural and fantastical influences into the design, but hold true to the science fiction we were creating without having to blame everything on \u201cmagic\u201d. The Eldrid were created specifically for those who appreciate elves, dwarves and other magical beings, but want to take them for a spin around the Last Star.<br><br><p align=\"center\"><img src=\"img\/lore-bible\/thorn_concept.jpg\"><br>Thorn concept design<\/p><br><strong>What influenced the design of the Eldrid?<\/strong><br><br>You certainly see that Nature theme woven throughout the Eldrid look. Eldrid factional armor tends to be flowing and organic and earth-toned. It echoes primitive undertones of plants, claws, or bones while harboring sophisticated inner-workings.  We pull equally from classical fantasy, wild plant life, and great fantasy visualizations like Princess Mononoke or Nausicca: Valley of the Winds.<br><br><p align=\"center\"><img src=\"img\/lore-bible\/mellka_final.jpg\"><br>Mellka concept design<\/p><br><strong>What do each of the Eldrid characters have in common? What are some differences between them?<\/strong><br><br>All of the Eldrid characters pull in elements from nature. Thorn\u2019s armor looks like insect chitin. Bolder crafted his shield from ancient runic ruins. Miko dresses in garments with strange sigils and signs. Even Mellka uses an artifact glove that has biologically mutated and grafted itself to her.<br><br><p align=\"center\"><img src=\"img\/lore-bible\/thorgrin1.jpg\"><br>Boldur concept design<\/p><br>But for all the themes, each Eldrid is quite different. Thorn is Aelfrin. Miko is the last mushroom-like being of its species. Boldur is a strange dwarf native to Ekkunar. They are all willing to fight for Eldrid beliefs and causes, but they all do so in different ways.<br><br><p align=\"center\"><img src=\"img\/lore-bible\/mellka_actionposes.jpg\"><br>Mellka's action poses<\/p><br><strong>Can you tell us a bit about some core Eldrid abilities?<\/strong><br><br>The Eldrid are masters of biology, and so feature greater Health and Health Regeneration by default than any other Battleborn group. This helps compensate for their refusal to use shields. Advanced biological techniques are used for much of their gear, which is more grown than fabricated. Eldrid almost never use shields, for example, preferring to use other natural or biological techniques for tending to combat-related injuries.<br><br><p align=\"center\"><img src=\"img\/lore-bible\/miko_01.jpg\"><br>Miko concept design<\/p><br>As Eldrid are very diverse in their cultures, every group has their own favorites and specialties in combat. The Aelfrin prefer bows and knives. The Ekkuni dwarves like heavy martial weapons. Miko biologically generates all of its kunai-thorns and spores as needed.<br><br><p align=\"center\"><img src=\"img\/lore-bible\/1_400.gif\"><img src=\"img\/lore-bible\/2_400.gif\"><br><img src=\"img\/lore-bible\/3_400.gif\"><img src=\"img\/lore-bible\/4_400.gif\"><br>Eldrid ability effect animations<\/p><br><strong>What are some key characteristics of Eldrid weapons?<\/strong><br><br>They are organic and biological, using advanced natural structures to channel potent and lethal energies.<br><br><p align=\"center\"><img src=\"img\/lore-bible\/mellka_bioblade2.jpg\"><br>Mellka's weapon design<\/p><br>Also, the Eldrid celebrate the significance of things they make. They often give names to their weapons.

Most of the planet consists of abundant organic life, occasionally fading into arid savannah. Very little of the planet consists of desert or polar caps, and large diverse vegetation covers most of the planet.<br><br><img src=\"img\/lore-bible\/BB_ekkunar_poster_en.jpg\"><br><br>Second \u2013 and most notable \u2013 the shattered planet defies all scientific explanation. Some cataclysm fractured the planet several thousand years ago. While still basically spherical, huge geological chunks of the planet are separated from one another, exposing the molten core of Ekkunar. The brightest scientists in the remaining universe are still trying to ascertain why the planet hasn\u2019t flown apart or settled back in on itself. The best guesses still fall back to near mysticism, citing the universe-law-bending Varelsi or some arcane machinery of Ekkuni Dwarves.<br><br><img src=\"img\/lore-bible\/daddy_golem.jpg\"><br><br><strong>Ekkunar Inhabitants<\/strong><br><br>Ekkunar was originally settled by a group of beings known as the Aztanti whose relics can still be seen stretched across a few of the remaining planets. The Aztanti spread out across the universe and are believed to be the seed race which grew into the Eldrid.<br><br><img src=\"img\/lore-bible\/thorgrin_frontview_render.jpg\"><br><br>Many millennia later, the native Ekkuni Dwarves are believed to inhabit vast tunnels below the planet\u2019s surface. Possessing an innate mystical understanding of botany and geology, the Ekkuni Dwarves harness the rocks and dangerous local flora to craft it into wearable pieces.<br><br><img src=\"img\/lore-bible\/alienplants.jpg\"><br><br>Only within the last 50 years or so have Eldrid groups returned in large numbers to Ekkunar, as their own worlds have been overrun and darkened by the Varelsi.  The Aelfrin re-settled Ekkunar en masse in 19905 C.R. after the darkening of their homeworld Eshteni. The Peacekeepers tried to settle on Ekkunar about 25 years after that, but were driven off-world by the very territorial Aelfrin supported by other Eldrid settlers.<br><br><strong>Ekkunar Features<\/strong><br><br><strong>Ruins of the ancient Aztanti<\/strong> are scattered across the planet. Even to this day they are inexplicable in size and the way they have withstood the wear of time. One of the greatest features of the ruins are massive (but now inert) golemic [DG(1] guardians crafted by the Aztanti for purposes unknown. They are often half-buried or intertwined with jungle growth.<br><br><img src=\"img\/lore-bible\/observatory_estab_shot.jpg\"><br><br>To further advance research into Varelsi phenomena, the Eldrid built the <strong>Amenine Observatory<\/strong>. Legendary Eldrid Observer Mossire founded the research center shortly after the Eldrid\u2019s re-settlement of the planet as a way to look into the nature of the Varelsi, their portaling technology, and how to best defeat them.<br><br>The <strong>Codex Regrowth<\/strong> is a testament to the Eldrid\u2019s determination to gain knowledge and preserve the natural order of the universe. There, the Eldrid have re-planted several seed-pods from the planet Codex in an attempt to re-grow the massive eliim trees and recover some of their lost knowledge troves. The grove of eliim trees are bio-engineered to be organic knowledge repositories capable of storing massive amounts of data, which only the Eldrid have the technology or ability to retrieve.<br><br><img src=\"img\/lore-bible\/bigpicture03.jpg\">"

They strive for perfection and they are not about to let something like mortality stand in their way. To that end, the Jennerit harness dark energies of the universe to twist the natural order of things as they see fit. In their bid to master life, members of the Jennerit must choose how they will use their power: Will they side with Rendain to bring the end of the universe? Or will they fight with the Battleborn to save the last star?<br><br><strong>Who are the Jennerit?<\/strong><br><br>Space vampires. No, we jest. They are almost certainly not space vampires. (But they kind of are space vampires.)<br><br><img src=\"img\/lore-bible\/rando-screen.jpg\"><br><br>At their peak - before the Varelsi threatened the remaining star systems in our universe - the Jennerit Empire was the most far-reaching civilization in existence.  They are extremely competent (if invasive) scientists, they are ruthlessly efficient at survival, and they have a strong appreciation for warfare and martial combat.<br><br>While there are a few races that comprise the star-spanning Empire, the core of the empire are members of the race called the \u201cJennerit\u201d. As a race, the Jennerit are known for angular features and four-fingered hands, which set them aside from the more \u201chuman\u201d denizens of the universe.<br><br>The Jennerit despise any race who express flaws and inefficiencies (which are, in fact, most other races). Even their own society has evolved into caste-based layers with the genetically-altered Sustained at the top, non-Sustained Jennerit just below them, and everything and everyone else below.  The Thralls are altered beasts who have been given a modicum of intelligence and are widely employed as a slave race for labor and as grunt warriors.<br><br><img src=\"img\/lore-bible\/building_layout_sketch.jpg\"><br><br><strong>Any Deed. Any Price.<\/strong><br><br>The Jennerit are pragmatists. They are perfectionists. Anything they deem imperfect must be fixed or destroyed. If the Jennerit need to manipulate the laws of the universe in the process, so be it. As the official motto of the Jennerit Empire states: \u201cAny Deed. Any Price.\u201d<br><br>To become Sustained, to live forever, is an alluring prospect. Tens of thousands of years ago, Empress Lenore discovered \u201cSustainment,\u201d a process by which the Jennerit can expend enormous amounts of power to make a single being all-but-immortal.  The Sustained do not age and do not grow ill from natural illnesses. There are Sustained Jennerit who are nearly 20,000 years old in the universe.<br><br>As mentioned, this process is extremely energy-expensive, consuming stored energy on a planetary scale just to alter one being. Therefore, Sustainment isn\u2019t done often, and candidates for sustainment are vetted through a rigorous process, finally approved by the Empress herself. What\u2019s even rarer, and quite unusual, is when a member of a non-Jennerit race is allowed to become Sustained.<br><br><img src=\"img\/lore-bible\/Rendain_Concept.jpg\"><br><br><strong>The Betrayal of Rendain<\/strong><br><br>Lothar Rendain, the right-hand of Empress Lenore for nearly 20,000 years, earned his spot by leading the Jennerit military. He even served as the central commander for multi-faction alliances against the Varlesi\u2026 then something changed.<br><br>As more solar systems winked out of existence, Rendain felt something needed to be done. The Varlesi and the coming Darkening seemed inevitable. The only practical solution seemed obvious to him - He had to survive. And that meant betraying his Empress and aiding in the destruction of the remaining universe. After all, when the objective is worth it: \u201cAny Deed. Any Price.\u201d<br><br>Seeing an inevitable alliance with the Varelsi as the most pragmatic option to survival, Rendain led a coup on the throneworld of Jennar, resulting in the Darkening of the planet and everyone on it\u2014including the Empress Lenore. Rendain\u2019s new order \u2013 named the Jennerit Imperium \u2013 began working with the Varelsi to finish the work of Darkening the universe. Those still loyal to the Empress were dealth with \u2013 or fled.<br><br>Now, Rendain fights a two-front war \u2013 alongside the Varlesi to destroy the remaining universe against the Battleborn and combating a growing resistance that\u2019s rising throughout the Jennerit Imperium."

Tempest has long been an artificially tidally-locked planet, set in orbit around the star, Solus. This creates a frozen side of the planet, a super-heated side of the planet, and a narrow, habitable equatorial band where most of the civilization resides. This also means that as a tidally-locked planet, Tempest is incredibly windy, reaching Category 5 hurricane force winds up to 255 km\/h. The Jennerit harness the immensely strong surface winds to power massive wind turbines.<br><br><img src=\"img\/lore-bible\/jen_poster2.jpg\"><br><br>In order to claim full mastery over Tempest, the Jennerit employ a massive moon-sized starship called Exodus. The starship houses the Sustainment Engine and massive power facilities capable of storing energy from other planets (like Tempest) for use in Sustainment. In short, Exodus is essential to harnessing the dark energies of the universe and powering the Jennerit\u2019s Sustainment process.<br><br>Despite its massive size, Exodus is capable of faster-than-light travel and often moves from planet-to-planet to collect vast amounts of energy to power Sustainment procedures. Many of the Sustained \u2013 and those worthy of being Sustained \u2013 live aboard Exodus, though some still reside on Tempest.<br><br><img src=\"img\/lore-bible\/castle_concept.jpg\"><br><br><strong>Tempest Features<\/strong><br><br>The settled band of Tempest has been built to reflect much of the cultures caste-based structure.

For some Rogues, that freedom means a life of freeing possessions from other people. For other Rogues, it just means living in isolation, free from the rules, restrictions, and conflict of the rest of the universe.<br><br><strong>Banding Together<\/strong><br><br>While the Rogues generally despise organizations and governance of any kind, there is one leader among them who they will rally behind when the conflict around the Last Star, Solus, requires a coordinated action. Reyna \u201cThe Valkyrie\u201d Valeria, known as the Rogue Commander, commands respect from almost all of the rabble in the Detritus Ring. Mostly because they all owe her favors.

The most ambitious of the Rogues usually fall into one of three forms of piracy: Raids, relics, or shardjumping.<br><br><strong>Raids<\/strong> are what you imagine \u2013 bandit attacks on unprotected settlements or ships. The Rogues are especially fond of raiding wealthy LLC ships that, while well-defended, are almost always worth the risk.<br><br>Rogues love to deal in rare artifacts and black market power. Across the Solus system, many of the planets are troves of <strong>Aztanti relics<\/strong> \u2013powerful remnants of a long-abandoned civilization. Most of these artifacts hold great and mysterious power, and are highly sought after by high bidders amongst the other factions. If you can get past the sentinels to claim them, that is.<br><br><img src=\"img\/lore-bible\/final_shardline_up.jpg\"><br><br><strong>Shardjumping<\/strong> is the most common and lucrative theft in the remaining universe. As stars are put under duress in a Darkening process, they exude waves of energy which coalesce into plasmite crystals (aka \u201cshards\u201d) when they pass through certain particles or atmospheres. These shards are highly charged with energy, and therefore, are prized where resources are low. Rogues are very adept at tracking shard formations and beating other claimants to those shardfalls. Or just taking the shards from someone else."

If I\u2019ve got to save a little money somewhere, this is it. I mean, it\u2019s nice to have a 6-mortar-shell-barrage light up enemies and damage their shields.

The LLC embodies the spirit of profit above all else - even as the universe is about to blink out of existence.<br><br><strong>Who are the Last Light Consortium?<\/strong><br><br>The LLC are the aristocratic merchant class of the galaxy at the end of the universe. They are the money and manufacturing arm of \u2026well, everything that is left. They are makers, and bankers, and entertainers, and traders, and sellers, and inventors, and war profiteers. Their ingenuity is only surpassed by their desire to turn a profit.<br><br>Originally a sub-group within the United Peacekeeping Republics (UPR), the Last Light Consortium parted ways a few decades back when the Peacekeepers attempted a forceful settlement of the Eldrid homeworld, Ekkunar, and failed. When the Eldrid resisted, the LLC decided to turn the turmoil into a business opportunity, mainly so they could keep selling war machines to both factions!<br><br><img src=\"img\/lore-bible\/ISIC_concept.jpg\"><br><br>Having always been experts at making robots and artificial intelligences, the LLC long ago accepted and recognized artificial intelligences (known as \u201cMagnuses\u201d) as equal members of their society \u2013 mostly thanks to a number of robotic revolutions and tentative, but profitable, peace negotiations. Now, the faction is split nearly equally between humans, Magnuses, and hybrids of the two, and they have avoided additional robot revolutions for nearly two centuries now!<br><br><strong>Taking Care of Business<\/strong><br><br>The LLC are comprised of dozens of guilds and corporations -- with the most notable of these being Minion Robotics. In a universe where combatants are running low, Minion Robotics positioned itself to become the \u201cpremier provider of custom-built \u2013 and cost effective \u2013 war machines for every need in the modern military campaign.\u201d They have become the dominant, if not monopolistic, crafter of death-dealing droids, ships, and weapons. Their products (including minions, sentries, and buildable battlefield augmentations) are in high demand from every corner of the rapidly-shrinking universe.<br><br>Minion Robotics has been around for nearly 500 years, and for most of that time was led by the Magnus CEO, ISIC. During the Great Severance, ISIC left Minion Robotics to seek other \u201cinterests.\u201d For a brief stint, the CTO of Minion Robotics, Gunnar Kleese, took over as CEO. Well, at least for a few hours until it became painfully apparent that no human could perform the complex administration needed for optimal efficiency.<br><br><img src=\"img\/lore-bible\/Marquis.jpg\"><br><br><strong>Profit, Luxury, and Invention<\/strong><br><br>The Last Light Consortium avoids anything that\u2019s bad for business. Even during these end times \u2013 when there are fewer potential clients \u2013 the LLC works tirelessly to expand profit margins and discover bold new financial paradigms to exploit. For many years, the LLC was run by a trade-specialist artificial intelligence, known as the Magna Carta. It officiated all of the trade compacts and agreements for the faction. To join the LLC required an established permanent link to the Magna Carta who administrated the position within the organization.<br><br>Profit, luxury, and invention are behind every LLC initiative. In fact, they are so incredibly wealthy that they value excessive demonstrations of that wealth, favoring overly-stylish design in every facet of daily living, from dress to their machines of war. It is the ultimate realization of corporate culture and unchecked capitalism \u2013 and, to them, it\u2019s glorious.<br><br>Things that jeopardize their interests: Radical mysticism, uncontrolled theft, non-renewable markets, and impediments of bureaucracy\u2026basically, anything that threatens boosts to quarterly revenues.<br><br>Oh, yes, and the end of the last star in the universe."

Each of them incorporate some kind of slick technology into their character, if they are not in fact entirely mechanical.<br><br><img src=\"img\/lore-bible\/phoebe_concept.jpg\"><br><br>On top of that, even the kindest of the LLC members have an air of aristocracy, entitlement, and affluence that cannot completely be shed; whether that means a daily assumption that someone is there to clean your dress, or firmware-held beliefs that all beings of lesser classes must be eliminated to raise the value of the remaining universe.<br><br><img src=\"img\/lore-bible\/el_dragon_concept2.jpg\"><br><br><strong>Can you tell us about LLC\u2019s abilities?<\/strong><br><br>Shields, shields, shields!

It could be someone\u2019s native ability to turbocharge the shields of allies or have the firepower to quickly sap enemy shields, leaving them vulnerable to attack.<br><br><img src=\"img\/lore-bible\/ISIC_concept.jpg\"><br><br>While the LLC is quick to turn a profit whenever possible, they are also the purveyors of fine, equipable Gear that will score you advantages on the battlefield. Don\u2019t be surprised to find LLC Gear which interacts with Buildable tactical structures, such as turrets and supply stations. Want a cost reduction when you build Turrets? LLC Gear. Want Supply Stations or Accelerators to have more health when you build them? LLC Gear. Want a constant increased payout of shards so you can activate more expensive Gear later, or build more Buildables? LLC Gear.

Those who like to heft some amped-up conventional firepower join the Peacekeepers.<br><br>To learn more about this futuristic space army, we spoke with <strong>Battleborn<\/strong>\u2019s Design Director, Brian Thomas, before signing up for duty.<br><br><img src=\"img\/lore-bible\/mike_concept.jpg\"><br><br><strong>What influenced the design of the Peacekeepers?<\/strong><br><br>These characters are a love letter to all the fun stuff we\u2019ve loved from the last 25 years of FPS gaming. The industry has really pivoted towards this ultra-realistic FPS combat in the last few years, so we wanted the Peacekeepers to bring back a lot of the fun, over-the-top gameplay that used to be the norm. So, Peacekeeper gameplay focuses around a lot of our favorite classic FPS weapons: Assault rifles, shotguns, grenades, rocket launchers, miniguns\u2026you know, the reliable standbys.<br><br><img src=\"img\/lore-bible\/benedict_concept.jpg\"><br><br><strong>What did you want to get across when conceptualizing and designing the Peacekeepers?<\/strong><br><br>We wanted everything to feel very practical and down to earth (or at least as down to earth as a flying hawk shooting rockets can be). When you play a Peacekeeper, you should be able to understand their abilities just by playing for a few seconds. But mastering these characters requires time and a lot of situational awareness \u2013 Unloading your shotgun, point blank \u2013 Leading your enemy into a rocket \u2013 Using your assault rifle\u2019s precision zooming to cluster headshots.<br><br><img src=\"img\/lore-bible\/gaililea_concept.jpg\"><br><br><strong>What do Peacekeeper Battleborn have in common?<\/strong><br><br>The short answer: Peacekeepers go into battle with \u201cguns\u2019n\u2019grenades.\u201d These characters should feel like they are literal in their fighting style, not relying on magic or high technology for their skills. But even within the Peacekeeper faction, each one has a different specialty on the battlefield. Oscar Mike is a utilitarian soldier, good at damage-dealing regardless of distance and cloaking to get away in a pinch. Ghalt is a more up close, stand-your-ground style fighter, who wants to draw you in with his hook, trap you, and unload his shotgun. Benedict, meanwhile, is there for aerial support, gliding above a fight while softening targets with rockets. Each of them has a range they\u2019re best at, and each of them have preferences about whether they want to fight an individual or a crowd. But at the end of the day, they all share that \u201cguns\u2019n\u2019grenades\u201d ideology.<br><br><img src=\"img\/lore-bible\/montana_concept.jpg\"><br><br><strong>What makes the Peacekeepers unique compared to the other factions?<\/strong><br><br>Peacekeepers are generally the most well-rounded faction. They don\u2019t do the most damage, tank the longest, or move the fastest, but they do all those things well. They also have very few weaknesses to hamstring them. This makes them some of the best utility team players in the game. No matter what your team composition looks like, Peacekeepers work well with everybody and help maintain your team\u2019s balance.<br><br><img src=\"img\/lore-bible\/trevor_turns.jpg\">"

            "text": "Composed of largely democratic societies, the Peacekeepers are an amalgamation of civilizations devoted to the preservation and protection of those sentient beings incapable of defending themselves from conquest or incursion. Many members of the Rogue faction originated in the UPR, including Reyna. Moreover, in the UPR\u2019s heyday, they spawned entire subfactions, such as the LLC, which later seceded from the UPR to stand apart as an autonomous governing body, in total control of its economic destiny.<br><br><img src=\"img\/lore-bible\/icescape_01.jpg\"><br><br><strong>What the Peacekeepers Keep Quiet<\/strong><br><br>However, not all of the UPR\u2019s motives are as righteous and altruistic as they\u2019d like to believe. At its best, the UPR is a strong, stalwart defense force providing basic necessities, resettlement and myriad other services to refugees of devastated populations. But there\u2019s a dark side to the UPR, one steeped in bureaucracy, draconian law enforcement, and even forbidden genetic experimentation and clone soldier production \u2013 activities that would lead Battleborn such as Whiskey Foxtrot to accuse the UPR of outright fascism. Where the other factions \u2013 the Eldrid, the Jennerit, the LLC, and the Rogues \u2013 can be characterized by their position on how to save Solus, the UPR\u2019s focus is squarely on the preservation of life, no matter the cost \u2013 even if the star is lost. In major conflicts, the UPR can most often be found on the front lines, evacuating civilians and salvaging tech for use in their next major showdown.<br><br><img src=\"img\/lore-bible\/bliss_poster_sm.jpg\"><br><br><strong>How did the Peacekeepers settle on Bliss?<\/strong><br><br>Bliss was hardly the UPR\u2019s first choice. As the Varelsi\u2019s star-darkening campaign claimed more and more UPR-controlled homeworlds, a new initiative was launched to seek out and claim lush new worlds to support their bolstering ranks. The UPR set their sights squarely on Ekkunar and began resettlement operations, much to the chagrin of the Eldrid and the Ekkuni natives, who waged a two-year campaign to drive the interlopers off of the verdant world.<br><br><img src=\"img\/lore-bible\/ice_sketch_04.jpg\"><br><br>At this point in the Battleborn timeline, the UPR has been significantly weakened by the secession of the Last Light Consortium, in addition to scores of costly battles throughout the galaxy, and the Ekkuni resistance eventually succeeds in driving the UPR offworld. As viable planets in orbit around a still-burning sun had become an increasingly valuable commodity, the UPR eventually settled on Bliss, the largest moon of the gas giant Nylo \u2013 the largest celestial body in orbit around Solus. A violent, inhospitable world, but hey: at least the atmosphere is breathable.<br><br><strong>Key Features of Bliss<\/strong><br><br>Though it may look largely homogenous from a distance, Bliss is a dynamic and geothermally active moon, beset by towering mountain ranges and pockmarked by highly active geological features like open magma floes and deep thermal pockets where some vegetation can grow on the surface. The Peacekeepers weren't the first colonists on Bliss. Scattered across the planet and nestled in deep cave networks below the surface are temples and ruined settlements of the ancient Aztanti. But even those settlements are built from and amongst the bones and fossilized scales of enormous dragons frozen eons ago in some unknown geological event.<br><br><img src=\"img\/lore-bible\/ice_sketch_03.jpg\">"

            "text": "The 26th <strong>Battleborn<\/strong>, Alani, has made her battleground debut to a tidal wave of enthusiasm from the community. But who is she really? What\u2019s her story? We managed to track down <strong>Battleborn<\/strong> Associate Producer, Anthony Nicholson for a few Alani tips and tricks. It turns out that Anthony had a big hand in creating Alani (along with a team of super talented developers), so he knows what he\u2019s talking about! Check out this interview with Anthony to learn more about Alani:<br><br>**What is Alani\u2019s story?*8<br><br>Alani is from the planet Akopos, a planet almost entirely comprised of water. She is a young, yet very mature monk that belongs to an order known as the Emula. A fierce fighter and a peaceful warrior, she was forced to go to the offensive when Rendain and the Jennerit began to syphon the water from her planet. This exterminated the vast majority of her species and left her with a goal to avenge her people and stop Rendain and the veiling of Solus. This is why she started her journey and became one of the <strong>Battleborn<\/strong>.<br><br><strong>How did Alani\u2019s character come to be?<\/strong><br><br>Alani is <strong>Battleborn<\/strong>\u2019s latest and greatest in the Support class. She acts as an attack-healer hybrid that brings a new dimension to the game where the better you are at attacking, the better you become at healing. Alani\u2019s character designer, Grant Kao, did a brilliant job wrapping these two roles into one by using a system that allows you to \u201cfill\u201d your passive ability, which directly affects your heal power, through landing hits on enemies. He also made quite a few augmentation decisions that allow the choice between heavier healing ability and damage, as well as the addition of crowd control effects. All of these things come together like a tidal symphony of power that makes Alani a true force of nature.<br><br><img src=\"img\/lore-bible\/double_bubble2.jpg\"><br><br><strong>Can you tell us a bit about her abilities and skills?<\/strong><br><br>Some of Alani\u2019s coolest abilities are her geyser that does a knock-up CC using a groundswell of water which when landed will bind an enemy player in a huge bubble! This allows allies to focus on enemies by participating in an intergalactic skeet shooting contest while your enemy is suspended in mid-air and makes for some really interesting team combos. This ability can also be augmented to give the geyser the ability to heal allies, widen its area of effect, and many other really interesting effects with this skill alone.  Another ability I really like is her ultimate skill, Emergence. I really wanted to see a HUGE Water Dragon hitting players and this ability always makes me smile. There is a really awesome mechanic here where the projectile you launch acts as a \u201csticky time bomb\u201d type of shot, that after a couple of second erupts a gigantic Water Dragon from the ground that leaves an area that does damage over time. What I like to do is throw this projectile onto an ally (YES! AN ALLY!!) Battleborn that has a dash and then have them dash into a group of enemies! IT\u2019s so great to watch that unfold in game!<br><br>Some of the best situations to use her abilities in are where you see a lot of enemies clumped together or on the other side of that coin, where you have a few allies in the same area. Alani\u2019s Riptide hastens her allies and can be augmented to slow enemies, apply damage over time and even heal. It is wise to use this ability in big group battles with the added bonus of wave clearing on Incursion and Meltdown maps. Alani\u2019s Geyser is a great tool for pulling enemies out of their skilled abilities and changing the tide. You can trump ISIC\u2019s Rotating Wards, Kelvin\u2019s Sublimate and even Galilea\u2019s Abyssal Form if you are skilled enough to time the eruption just right!<br><br><strong>How does Alani fit on a team?<\/strong><br><br>Alani fits in as a healer first so any team composition that lacks a Reyna, Miko or Kleese would greatly benefit from her presence. To take it another step, I like using a team comprised of Caldarius, Attikus, Oscar Mike and Kleese. This team has heavy damage, shield support and some added mobility that allows Alani to heal and get a ton of assists while giving the team a high caliber of survivability.<br><br>When Alani is on a team with other Support characters, brace yourself! It will be difficult to take them down when they are together so you will need to make the enemy team scatter. When she has a majority team of attackers, she does well to sit near and direct heal them as well as lay down abilities augmented to increase healing power and healing stimulation on your teammates. In Story missions, she is phenomenal at keeping her allies alive and spreading death using her crowd control and area of effect abilities.<br><br><img src=\"img\/lore-bible\/Alani_Full_Osmosis.jpg\"><br><br><strong>How do you play Alani?<\/strong><br><br>I play Alani in EVERY WAY! I created her to have a huge variety of skills and move sets that Grant really brought to life along with the Animation, FX and Art teams who worked on her, making her readily available for all to dive in. Not a very skilled player? Attack when you can and stay near your allies to heal at will. Oh, you\u2019re a Master of Battleborn? Choose your augments that allow you to increase healing and survivability for your team while strategically using your skills to funnel the enemy where you want them to go. There is no bad way to play Alani! If you want to be a super healer, you\u2019ll want to be pretty good at attacking as well. The way I really enjoy playing her? Anyway that ends with me killing an enemy and taunting! I also like keeping her Osmosis pool filled because when it is, her tattoos and eyes glow and I LOOOOOVE that!!<br><br>No matter how you choose to play her, I am confident that you will really have a blast doing so. My goal was to provide a deep background, majestic aquatic beauty, awesome visuals and sick gameplay mechanics to introduce a character like no other to the Solus system and I feel the spectacular Gearbox Design and Creative teams took the plunge and made a dramatic splash!"

            "text": "One of the Eldrid's heavy hitters, the massive ice golem Kelvin is among Battleborn's more interesting heroes. Besides being an all-around cool guy, he's also a versatile character with great crowd control and tanking options depending on your play style. We caught up with Lead Programmer Scott Velasquez, our resident Kelvin expert, to learn more about one of Battleborn's unsung heroes. Read on for some cold hard facts on the Eldrid's muscle!<br><br><img src=\"img\/lore-bible\/kelvin_concept.jpg\"><br><br><strong>What is Kelvin's story?<\/strong><br><br>Kelvin is from RM6 (Rocky Moon 6) of the planet Arcturi.  His age is unknown, but it is known that his species is composed of a vast colony of \"kelvite\" microorganisms.  Kelvin is capable of sentient thought and is able to rapidly move and re-form into various shapes.  With an extreme dislike for Jennerit explosives, Kelvin is fond of ice sculpting and extremely cold weather.  Kelvin generally goes where Miko goes and is always sympathetic to \"protecting the less fortunate\".<br><br><strong>How did Kelvin's character come to be?<\/strong><br><br>The idea for Kelvin was created back early last year, when the team was pitching ideas for characters every day. Originally Kelvin was pitched as an alien trapped inside an ice golem, where the two entities would combine powers. The idea for an ice character was one everyone liked, so that element was pulled out for further exploration. Fun fact - at around this same time, the idea for Toby was being pitched as well. Since penguins and ice go together like Montana and Oscar Mike, an early concept of Kelvin incorporated Toby. Instead of having an alien inside the ice golem, Toby's crashed space glider was lodged in Kelvin's body.<br><br><img src=\"img\/lore-bible\/kelvin_02.jpg\"><br><br><strong>Can you tell us a bit about his abilities and skills?<\/strong><br><br>Kelvin is a large melee character with amazing crowd control abilities.  He also has the ability to grow his health pool incredibly large and with certain helix and gear choices, Kelvin can reach health regeneration numbers higher than any other Battleborn.  There is a new feature coming down the pipe that will make these numbers even more fun to track; a stat lover's dream!<br><br>Sublimate is one of Kelvin's starting abilities and is his bread and butter ability for stunning enemies and doing a bit of damage on each touch.<br><br>His ultimate, Ice Wall, is another great crowd control ability that can block the paths of enemies and friendlies alike.  If placed directly on an enemy, the enemy will also be stunned for a short period of time!<br><br>Kelvin can regenerate his health reactively, but he also can protect himself proactively, similar to Reyna in that he gains shield strength every time he completes any skill.  This gives Kelvin a damage buffer before hitting his health pool which comes in really handy!<br><br><strong>How does Kelvin fit on a team?<\/strong><br><br>Kelvin fits in as a great crowd control pick and tank depending on the team's needs.  When paired with a healer in competitive play, Kelvin can be a nuisance to the enemy team.<br><br>If focusing on crowd control look to his helix for choices that reduce comedown times for Sublimate and Ice Wall.  Consider bringing in one cooldown piece of gear as well.<br><br>Kelvin can start as a strong tank out of the gate at level one with his \u201cDensity\u201d mutation which grants an extra 360 maximum health.  However, to reach his full tanking potential, focus on landing his Chomp ability and build your maximum health pool as large as possible so you can soak up the damage for your team!<br><br><strong>How do you play Kelvin?<\/strong><br><br>Tank and support characters are two of my favorites, so I\u2019m a big fan of Kelvin.  I play Kelvin aggressively as an initiator while also keeping tabs on the battlefield, looking to help a teammate in trouble.  After pinging my focus target, I love diving into a group of enemies, stunning them with Sublimate to initiate a team fight and watching as my team pours in to help pick off the enemies.  Landing a well-placed Ice Wall that prevents enemies from escaping will get your team pumped!  I also have fun trying to reach new records with my maximum health pool, which the game tracks so you can share and compete with your friends!<br><br>If you want to be the best Kelvin possible, concentrate on completing his lore challenges and earn his hand crafted legendary item, Plasmite-Infused Plating.<br><br>The other gear I tend to use with Kelvin are attack speed and damage items.  In capture mode though, use white gear as the matches end quickly.<br><br>Here are links to my favorite builds, courtesy of www.battlebornforum.com:<br><br><ul><li>Story helix build<\/li><li>Versus build<\/li><ul><br>The team did a great job on Kelvin.  I love his gear set, his first and third person model and effects, and the personality he provides through his animation and dialog.  Give him a shot, he's fun to play!<br><br><img src=\"img\/lore-bible\/kelvin_blog.jpg\"><br><br><strong>Tips<\/strong><br><ul><li>Simple as A-B-C: Always Be Chompin!<\/li><li>Don't overlook Kelvin's alternate attack which does an area of effect damage. Its rate scales off of attack speed and can be very effective!<\/li><li>Be careful attacking enemies with stuns, push backs, and high maneuverability.<\/li><li>Remember: that as Kelvin you're not out to score kills, though they do happen occasionally.  Focus on setting up your teammates and you'll be racking up assists!<\/li><\/ul>"

Each Competitive Multiplayer mode will have a new map that also brings a bit of a new spin on the classic Incursion, Meltdown, and Capture modes. Let\u2019s take a closer look at what\u2019s coming in the next update!<br><br><img src=\"img\/lore-bible\/monuments4.jpg\"><br><br><strong>Incursion Map \u2013 Monuments<\/strong><br><br>Ekkunar, the last large green planet in the universe, has always been highly contested by those fleeing the darkened universe.

It will be a brutal fight to gain territory and drive the other team away before they can gain a foothold among the mysterious and powerful secrets of abandoned Aztanti technology.<br><br><img src=\"img\/lore-bible\/monuments6.jpg\"><br><br>There are many points of interest on Monuments that hold strategic importance including\u2026<br><br><ul><li>There is a Skill Jump path over the middle of the map leads to your first sentry, and you\u2019re going to want to defend this point aggressively. If left unguarded, agile enemy players can sneak in easily at this spot and get access to your sentry.<\/li<br><li>A high ledge overlooks the Minion lane entering your first sentry, and is a perfect place for a long-rage character to dominate. As a bonus, there\u2019s a nearby Shard that can be farmed when your sniper isn\u2019t raining pain down from this perch.<\/li><li>You\u2019ll want to keep your Logistics nodes built and maintained to keep your Minion waves running at top speed.<\/li><li>Keep an eye out for a back route to sneak into your enemy\u2019s Boss Sentry area.<\/li><\/ul><br><img src=\"img\/lore-bible\/monuments29.jpg\"><br><br>Monuments hold advantages for all kinds of playstyles. As mentioned previously, the Skill Jump pillars in the middle of the map are a back flank route to the opposing team\u2019s sentry which can be exploited by agile characters. Brawlers and other high DPS characters can shut down the Minions lane leading into their Sentry areas while your long-rage players hold the high spots. And for stealthy characters, there\u2019s a Thrall cave under the center of the map where you can sneak in close to the enemy\u2019s first sentry.<br><br><img src=\"img\/lore-bible\/outskirts27.jpg\"><br><br><strong>Meltdown Map \u2013 Outskirts<\/strong><br><br>Despite a planet-wide Thrall rebellion, Minrec has established a new recycling\/appeasement facility in the lower city slums of the Jennerit planet, Tempest.

Long-range characters should use the sniper roosts that sit above each lane as they are easy to defend and offer nice sightlines to the minion waves. Heavy-hitters will want to hang out in the middle of the map and make use of the multiple doorways there to gain access to both lanes and offer quick support where needed. As for stealth characters, they\u2019ll want to spend time in the bottom of the Mausoleum in the center of the slum\u2019s lane.

            "text": "<img src=\"img\/lore-bible\/Pendles_blog.jpg\"><br><br><strong>PENDLES GAMEPLAY REVEAL<\/strong><br><br>Hailing from the same ocean world as his pal Alani, Pendles is a member of the Roa, a traditionally peaceful snake-like race. Adolescent Roa are encouraged to leave home to explore the universe around them, and Pendles did just that. Short on cash and not too impressed with the cultures he encountered, he found much more enjoyment \u2013 and money \u2013 as an assassin-for-hire.<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=pa-xiYTJQSc<br><br>While Roa go through part of their lives as bipedal creatures, they eventually shed their limbs and return to living beneath the waves. Not Pendles though! He was having so much fun murdering other cultures around the universe that when his natural molting process began, he was very much not thrilled. Suddenly, he found himself without a right tentacle. He put a halt to the process through hormone therapy, then acquired himself a nifty prosthetic arm - greatly improving both his penmanship and high-fives.<br><br>There\u2019s no question, this Rogue\u2019s rogue is a cold-blooded killer. With poison, stealth, and an unhealthy inclination for murder, Pendles will sneak up behind you, perforate you with dual kamas, then disappear without leaving a trace. Oh yeah, and one of his kamas is made from the skull of a previous target. The universe is in desperate need of saving and Varelsi are on the doorstep, but Ghalt felt it was safer to have him on the team, than not.<br><br>If you want to be a ssssuccesssful ssssnake, take advantage of Pendles\u2019 unique abilities! Since he gains extra movement speed while in stealth, Pendles makes for an excellent shard farmer who can benefit himself and his team by keeping the shard count high. As you zip around the map, pick off any stragglers you see, especially those on low health trying to retreat to safety. When Pendles gets to higher levels, his ability to 1v1 medium and low health characters goes up, making him even more effective at picking off solo players who wander from the group. Lastly, keep moving. Hit someone with Injection and a few melees and run behind a corner to activate Cornersneak.<br><br>With Pendles\u2019 ability to be almost constantly in stealth, he may seem overwhelming to play against. However, there are some tips you should follow if you find yourself in need of an edge against the serpentine assassin. Team coordination is a must, when you\u2019re playing against a team with Pendles on it it\u2019s dangerous to go alone. If you find yourself separated from the group, you\u2019re a prime target for a Pendles stealth kill. Specific <strong>Battleborn<\/strong> like Marquis, Orendi and Ambra have augments that Reveal enemy <strong>Battleborn<\/strong>, so use them to draw Pendles out of hiding when you need. And lastly, try combatting an enemy Pendles with a Pendles of your own. Have him hang around your squishier allies, soaking up XP. When the enemy Pendles initiates combat, that\u2019s your chance to take him head-on!<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=O0zpmT7xekI<br><br><strong>DUAL KAMAS & THROWING STARS:<\/strong> Slice and dice enemies while dual-wielding kamas or pick them off from a distance with throwing stars.<br><br><strong>SNAKE-BORN:<\/strong> This slippery serpent is naturally elusive which grants him the ability to slip out of stuns, snares, and other crowd control (CC) measures faster.<br><br><strong>SMOKE BOMB:<\/strong> Toss a smoke bomb on the ground and disappear. *POOF* Those pesky bombs also deal damage over time to enemies in the area.<br><br><strong>INJECTION:<\/strong> A good assassin has many tricks up his sleeves.

Some might call him a well-aged boy scout, but Ernest\u2019s sense of honor and duty brings a new means of support and defense previously absent from the Peacekeepers \u2013 this is no small part thanks to his grenade launcher. The various explosive ordinance rounds help Ernest lean on the offensive or provide a mean line of defense for his team.

That\u2019s when Ernest signed up for general combat duty in the UPR. Ernest\u2019s considerable talents with explosive ordinance translated fluidly to combat, and he accomplished much in his three years alongside the Rapid Deployment Corps.<br><br>When the war finally arrived on Menneck\u2019s doorstep, Ernest begged for reassignment to his home system. The aviant that returned was different than the one who left. His optimism, tempered and hardened. His spirit and devotion to his people, however, remained intact. In the battle to save Menneck, Ernest served on the front lines of the evacuation.

The Way of the Emulan monks lives on, however, through the most unlikely of their order: Alani.<br><br>For an underwater monastic sect that preaches inner calm and fluid mindfulness, Alani certainly seems to have a sunny and outgoing disposition. Perhaps it's because, given that the order was eradicated, Alani never had the opportunity to reach the zen calm espoused by the elders. But more likely, her natural zeal and vitality was inherited through her Helician lineage. Strange as it may seem, Alani is not actually a native of Akopos: her human father and Helician mother, under such circumstances as are often left to be wondered about for a lifetime, gave her to the Emulan monks. Maybe they meant to come back for her later, when circumstances changed. Maybe they didn't. Poor Alani may never know.<br><br>You may ask, \"Are Helicians aquatic?\" and to that, I'd say catch Galilea Azmozeus try and tell a joke, you can't get much drier. Luckily, through the surgical modification prowess of the Emula, Alani was soon breathing and swimming through water with the best of them. Typically, however, the Helicians natural hardiness is more than enough to see them through any hostile environment, and incompatible lungs are far from the worst a Helician has faced. Indeed, their longevity and stubborn vigor put them at natural odds against the Jennerit, whose own aims of artificial eternity brought them enormous jealousy (given that the natural Jennerit lifespan lasts only a few centuries). This enmity came to a head with the War of Being (C.R. 19208-19304), in which the Helician Corps played a critical role among the Arbiters of Being (Eldrid elite warriors trained and equipped specifically to combat the Sustained). Incidentally, it was during the War of Being that the planet-being Mikollopria released spores to aid in the war effort; among those spores was the bud that would come to be known as \u201cMiko\u201d among the Battleborn.<br><br>Ultimately, the Jennerit emerged victorious, and the Helicians were soon subjugated as a servant-caste, whose only avenue of recognition was through military excellence in service of those they reviled. Small wonder, then, that Alani isn\u2019t particularly fond of the Jennerit after they conquered one of her peoples and destroyed the other."

However, during a Varelsi mass-teleportation sequence, Mephis exhibited aberrant behavior, sending communications with non-standard encryptions, disabling auto-targeting systems, and routing a capital ship directly into The Wiseman, which drifted into the gravity well of Sau Nona and crashed.<br><br>As a result, users report less than .3% of the population was evacuated from inhabited worlds in the system (Itka, Sau Nona, Madan, Stragi, and Ezun, Stragi\u2019s largest moon). Additionally, a large number of transports were reported missing.<br><br>The black box of The Wiseman is unrecovered, but data indicates it was intact at the time of impact. We\u2019ve tested data recorder integrity under Dark-like conditions and it should remain stable for approximately 20 years.<br>Due to the inconsistent functionality of Mephis at the time of impact, it is difficult to determine to severity of damage the Magnus sustained, if any.<br><br>Steps to Reproduce ----------<br>1.

Is this an isolated case?<br><br>_[Elandra Saint-Wu] replied - 5 days ago<br>\/\/\/So far, this is the only reported case, but this single incident was reported over 200 times, mostly UPR officers and other premium users involved in the evacuation. Also, , please update the bug description to include the established term \u201cportal bloom\u201d for searchability.<br><br>[Bertram Hastings] replied - 5 days ago<br>\/\/\/... okayyy, can we get a sample of this non-standard encryption? Might be able to back-engineer some of the issue if my team can see these effects. Also, who shot that surface footage? Pinging .<br><br>[Elandra Saint-Wu] replied - 5 days ago<br>\/\/\/I\u2019ve attached an audio log sifted from a data packet burst on the emergency channels during the issue. Unfortunately, since Mephis wasn\u2019t parsing traffic correctly, virtually all channels\u2019 signal-to-noise was shot to hell. As for the surface footage, judging from the low viewing angle and resolution, this was a personal recorder held by a Finisci; this would also account for the shaking, if it was held by flippers instead of hands.<br><br>[Morton Barrett] added a comment - 4 days ago<br>\/\/\/The audio log is actually two layers, one from an organic source, probably a female Buteonen judging from vocal signatures, and the other synthesized. So far, I\u2019ve only been able to decrypt the word \u201cAugustus\u201d and a fragment of coordinates, presumably from the onboard navigation system. If we can recover either that transport or, better yet, Mephis himself, I can get a much better look at this issue.<br><br>[Gunnar Kleese] added a comment - 2 days ago<br>\/\/\/Yes, yes, this is all well and fine, but what good is this information with that dismal reproduction rate? 1\/1, really? Can we get QA on this?<br><br>[Elandra Saint-Wu] replied - 2 days ago<br>\/\/\/ We would need a Magnus fresh off the line as well as a few hundred thousand tons of UPR materiel to house it in. Then we\u2019d have to navigate it directly into the path of a Varelsi portal sequence during the brief window while it\u2019s active.<br><br>[Gunnar Kleese] replied - 1 day ago<br>\/\/\/ Thank you for providing ME the details of how to do YOUR job. It\u2019s clear you know how to proceed, you know where to find me when you\u2019re done. Resolving NMI (Needs More Information)."

            "text": "FROM THE DESK OF RENDAIN, YOUR TYRANT<br>TO: Secretary Boolicsyco<br>FROM: New Jennerit Empire Interim Chief Counselor Deande<br>DATE: y.19959, d.8<br><br>Fred, your negligence bordering on incompetence as underwarsecretary proved vital to my success. However, your performance in the coming weeks will in large part decide your continued career outside of a jail cell. Though you were inarguably complicit with the worst war criminal this universe has ever known, I\u2019ve convinced Lord Executor Vylo that your utility during this transition outweighs the danger you pose to society. Do not test me. Now, I\u2019ve begun preparations on an actionable itinerary, and will need you to make the necessary arrangements:<br><br>Item 1: Please contact Dr. G. Kleese aboard the UPR engineering ship Nova and inform him that I need his assistance in changing the Tyrant\u2019s official letterhead. It appears that Rendain hasn\u2019t updated his operating system in decades and I can\u2019t make heads or tails of it. [Personal note: As happy as I am not being in the same room as that lunatic, if anyone is qualified for archaic tech support, it\u2019s Kleese.]<br><br>Item 2: I am appointing former Blademaster Verod Rath to the office of Warmaster, along with all its titles and honors. Issue a summons order to Lord Commander Rath and schedule a meeting with whoever is Lord of Ceremonies these days. Additionally, the positions of Blademaster and Spymaster are now vacant. Reach out to the other Counselors and schedule a meeting to discuss possible candidates. [Personal note: Rath might not like being pulled from the front lines, but if the Jennerit people are to survive, we cannot afford to overlook his strategic value as a commander.]<br><br>Item 3: The Pact of the Dying. Send word to The Guilded Enclave, \u201cCommander\u201d Reyna Valeria, The High Observatory, and Chancellor V. Shields that we need to convene to renew the Pact and discuss changes to its terms. [Personal note: we can finally change that ghastly name; it appears we may not be \u201cDying\u201d after all.]<br><br>Item 4: Thus far, the only common language established with the Varelsi is violence. We\u2019ll need to determine some other method of cultural exchange if the Empire is to survive, now that Rendain\u2019s arrangement is broken. Contact Baroness Phoebe Hemsworth IV of the LLC and request an audience\u2014Phoebe is one of the universe\u2019s leading researchers in the field of Void sciences, and may be our best hope for deciphering how Rendain managed to negotiate his treasonous agreement with the Varelsi. [Personal note: need to ask Mellka if the Eldrid have installed a new Black Observer yet.]<br><br>Item 5: The Jennerit people have always admired personal excellence above all else, and require a hero to venerate, following this nasty \u201cdeposing\u201d business. I had submitted the Thrall liberator Attikus for the Rite of Sustainment, but he rejected the honor out of hand, something about \u201cenough experiments for more than one lifetime.\u201d Speak with Sister Benniteg and get me a short list of other possible options, someone who would look good in a parade. [Personal note: contact Galilea and see if she\u2019s interested in finishing what she started.]<br><br>Item 6: Speaking of the Thrall, release notes had indicated that their infertility was biologically enforced, assuring us that their population would never be host to unforeseen genetic variance. It would appear that, following the destruction of the broodhalls, they have proven her wrong. Life has found a way. The Thrall diaspora has scattered them across the system, and we receive reports daily of new pups being whelped. Contact Dr. B. Lucavi and set up a meeting. [Personal note: loath as I am to further modify them, if we can\u2019t get this gestation period in check, a population boom will deplete what little resources remain.]<br><br>Item 7: Last item. The matter of Constable Cuddles. It appears that Lothar personally oversaw the daily care of the royal lapdog. My schedule does not allow such personalized attention. I will be appointing a replacement I have personally and thoroughly vetted. However, given that the replacement is not of Jennerit descent, I will see to it that a measure of special care be taken to stay abreast of his performance and demeanor. [Personal note: not a permanent solution, of course, but this is the only way to get at least SOME time with that handsome blue devil.]<br><br>Addressing these issues should buy us some time until the next crisis arises, by which time I expect the Empress to relieve me and take a firmer grip on the wheel of the Empire. Which reminds me, inform Guard Captain Crex that I want a full complement of his finest to non-violently suppress attempts at memorial services for Lenore. I\u2019ve heard far too many whispers of mourning and don\u2019t want people getting the wrong idea. [Personal note: I know she\u2019s alive. While she lives, so does the empire, and so does Solus.]"

Heck, I\u2019d settle for Toby.

Please, tell me you're joking.<br><br><font color=\"#FF9900\">PENDLES:<\/font> Egg-grog's nothin' to joke about, it's an important part of the rich Roguish tradition of Newshines Day!<br><br><font color=\"#33CCCC\">PHOEBE:<\/font> New...shines...<br><br><font color=\"#FF9900\">PENDLES:<\/font> Day, yeah! Oh, it's a riot, everyone swaps their external navigation lamps to all sorts of brilliant colors, you put a mylar blinder over ya helmet, you get an excuse to put on your ugliest space suit for the Brightwalk and watch good ol' Solus flare up, out there with your egg-grog--<br><br><font color=\"#B2CC80\">MONTANA:<\/font> Just a minute chief, how d'ya drink egg-grog while you're wearing a space-suit and helmet?<br><br><font color=\"#BFBFBF\">\/\/NOVA NOTE: I\u2019ll just send them messages instead of talking.<br>[open mail client, begin message: Hey Montana, could you please put that engine back where you found it? I know how much you like big, heavy things, but that one is MY big heavy thing. Thanks!]<br>\/\/NOVA NOTE: There, sent. Any second now, he\u2019s going to get my message and put my engine back.<\/font><br><br><font color=\"#FF9900\">PENDLES:<\/font> Sorry mate, trade secret. Anyway, at midnight, you have the best part, the Newshines Shoe-Shine!<br><br><font color=\"#33CCCC\">PHOEBE:<\/font> I'm sorry, I must have misheard you\u2014did you just say you only shine your shoes once a year?<br><br><font color=\"#FF9900\">PENDLES:<\/font> Well, no\u2014Newshines Day is pretty new, I'd say that strictly speaking, I've shined my shoes once every 20 years, give or take, and that wasn\u2019t so much a shine so much as it was stepping in a particularly clean puddle. But going forward, yeah, that's right, once a year, Newshines Shoe-Shine. You take a gob of spit and some elbow grease, you wipe away all the muck and grime you slogged through to get from where you were to where you are, and BLA-DOW! Your sneakers are prepped for a fresh new year of sneaking experiences.<br><br><font color=\"#33CCCC\">PHOEBE:<\/font> Spit and elbow grease? How...charming.<br><br><font color=\"#BFBFBF\">\/\/NOVA NOTE: Aaany second now.<\/font><br><br><font color=\"#FF9900\">PENDLES:<\/font> Oh yeah, and I s'pose you lot in the LLC have got something that's right BRIMMING with charm, do ya?<br><br><font color=\"#33CCCC\">PHOEBE:<\/font> As a matter of fact, we do!<br><br><font color=\"#FF9900\">SHAYNE:<\/font> Pfft, 'oh-kay', what's your dumb holiday got, besides no egg-grog?<br><br><font color=\"#BFBFBF\">\/\/NOVA NOTE: I\u2019m dying of boredom. This is it. This is how I die. Engine-less, entombed in light strips and wet paint, to the dirge of twinkly bells and happy choral melodies. Somehow, I knew this is how it would end.<\/font><br><br><font color=\"#33CCCC\">PHOEBE:<\/font> Well, you get to take the day off...<br><br><font color=\"#FF9900\">AUROX:<\/font> YES, AND?<br><br><font color=\"#33CCCC\">PHOEBE:<\/font> That's...that's it. OH! and the Friday before is Casual Friday, so, you can wear silver trimmings instead of gold, if you like.<br><br><font color=\"#FF9900\">REYNA:<\/font> Damn. Y'all LLC really know how to let loose. And uh, just what do you call this day of debauchery and indulgence?<br><br><font color=\"#33CCCC\">PHOEBE:<\/font> Wellll, the name is still being workshopped a bit, and the Guild hasn't decided whether it will be recurring or not, but for now, they're calling it\u2014<br><br><font color=\"#33CCCC\">EL DRAG\u00d3N:<\/font> \u2014Company Holiday 17! The greatest of all holidays!<br><br><font color=\"#BFBFBF\">\/\/NOVA NOTE: Obviously, he\u2019s forgetting Severance Day. I bet he took one too many blows to the head. That\u2019s why I keep mine stored behind armor-plated paneling. In space.<\/font><br><br><font color=\"#FF9900\">SHAYNE:<\/font> Sounds lame. Everyone gets a day off, big deal.<br><br><font color=\"#33CCCC\">EL DRAG\u00d3N:<\/font> A-ha, but it is the BIGGEST of deals, because EVERYONE gets the day off, and for liability purposes, everyone HAS to take the holiday. INCLUDING internal security, the legal team, everyone! They can't hold LLC employees accountable for any damage to company property or staff for 24 hours!<br><br><font color=\"#00FF00\">MELLKA:<\/font> WOAHHHH hold on, now this is getting rad! So you have a grudge day where everyone just does what they want and you can steal and fight and vandalize junk to vent all your pent-up frustrations?<br><br><font color=\"#33CCCC\">EL DRAG\u00d3N:<\/font> I...I never thought of it like that, I mostly used the day to practice my Super Sentry submission holds, but, I suppose you could? The offices are mostly empty though, it would be hard to find opponents, but...yes, yes! With the access code to the Galactic Holo-Arena, or with robot-arms strong enough to rip the doors open, you could host THE FIRST LLC BATTLE ROYALE! Finally, Jen from the mail room will suffer the mighty wrath of EL DRAG\u00d3\u00d3\u00d3N! We'll see how much she likes eating other peoples' lunches when she has no TEETH! HAHAHAAaaa...Please excuse me, I must make a few calls.<br><br><font color=\"#BFBFBF\">\/\/NOVA NOTE: That actually sounds fun as heck.<br>[open mail client, begin message: Dear Kleese, robot suit.]<br>\/\/NOVA NOTE: Send. I\u2019m getting good at this.<br>[open mail client, begin message: Dear El Drag\u00f3n, sign me up.]<br>\/\/NOVA NOTE: Send. I wonder if his new arms are detachable like his old ones.<\/font><br><br><font color=\"#00FF00\">MELLKA:<\/font> Man, I wish the Eldrid would have a battle royale. All we have is \u2018Lightbloom\u2019.<br><br><font color=\"#CC0000\">RATH:<\/font> What in the world is \u2018Lightbloom\u2019?<br><br><font color=\"#00FF00\">MELLKA:<\/font> Eh, it\u2019s this thing where everyone gives a \u2018gift\u2019 in the morning\u2026<br><br><font color=\"#FF9900\">SHAYNE:<\/font> Oo, like a second birthday?<br><br><font color=\"#00FF00\">MELLKA:<\/font> Kind of, but the gift is usually a plant or something, sometimes an egg, sometimes a rock, but whatever you get, you\u2019re supposed to be thankful because it represents\u2026something.<br><br><font color=\"#00FF00\">THORN:<\/font> Life, child, it represents the natural beauty of life.<br><br><font color=\"#00FF00\">MELLKA:<\/font> Whatever. And then the night of Lightbloom, you open your gift, or it blooms, or hatches, or\u2026sits there, if you got a rock. You tie the flower, or the shell, or rock to a moonbulb, which is like, this glowing, floating plant from Ekkunar, and then you let it float off into oblivion.<br><br><font color=\"#FF9900\">SHAYNE:<\/font> So you guys just get a bunch of flowers and stuff you can get from outside and trade it around?<br><br><font color=\"#BFBFBF\">\/\/NOVA NOTE: I went outside once. That was nice.<\/font><br><br><font color=\"#00FF00\">MELLKA:<\/font> No, everyone just gets one gift. Anyway, the Green Observer says it\u2019ll help to regulate the migratory patterns of the amber starhawk, since the sky is, you know, disappearing.<br><br><font color=\"#B2CC80\">BENEDICT:<\/font> Well, speaking as somethin\u2019 of a hawk myself, that sounds confusin\u2019 as hell. How does everyone know who gets what? And how do y\u2019all make sure the gift blooms or hatches or whatever at the right time?<br><br><font color=\"#00FF00\">MELLKA:<\/font> I honestly have no idea, I was wondering the same thing the first time, but it just kind of worked out\u2014I mean, you may as well ask me how the claw knows when I want to stab someone with it.<br><br><font color=\"#B2CC80\">BENEDICT:<\/font> Hey, yeah, how the hell DOES it\u2014<br><br><font color=\"#00FF00\">MELLKA:<\/font> I said I have no idea, Benedict! Eldrid science is weird that way. Just trust me, it works.<br><br><font color=\"#B2CC80\">BENEDICT:<\/font> Y\u2019all need to take a page from the UPR Field Manual and keep it simple. That\u2019s what I like about the BUF Festival, all you have to remember are the 3 F\u2019s: Fireworks, Feats of Strength, and Falafel! As long as you\u2019ve got those, your party is good to go!<br><br><font color=\"#33CCCC\">PHOEBE:<\/font> And what, pray tell, does \u2018BUF\u2019 stand for?<br><br><font color=\"#B2CC80\">OSCAR MIKE\/MONTANA\/BENEDICT (in unison):<\/font> Bright Universe Festival!<br><br><font color=\"#BFBFBF\">\/\/NOVA NOTE: If I can just reach\u2026that\u2026control panel\u2026I can turn off the music and reactivate my default voice parameters and\u2026no. No, wait. That\u2019s right, I don\u2019t have hands. Dang.<\/font><br><br><font color=\"#00FF00\">KELVIN:<\/font> So, the UPR celebrates the rekindling of Solus with the \u2018Bright Universe Festival\u2019 Festival, with 3 F\u2019s?<br><br><font color=\"#FF9900\">WHISKEY FOXTROT:<\/font> Kelvin, don\u2019t bother, I\u2019ve already tried explaining to these jackasses\u2014<br><br><font color=\"#B2CC80\">OSCAR MIKE:<\/font> Heck yeah!<br><br><font color=\"#00FF00\">KELVIN:<\/font> \u2026Very well.<br><br>[negligible background noise for 15 seconds]<br><br><font color=\"#BFBFBF\">\/\/NOVA NOTE: This is WAY awkward. And funny. I wish I had some popcorn. Oh wait, I\u2019m a virtual construct, I can make pretty much anything in my cyber-brain.<br>\/\/NOVA NOTE: Hey, that worked! This popcorn virtually tastes great. I wonder what else I can do in here.<\/font><br><br><font color=\"#CC0000\">AMBRA:<\/font> \u2026Really.<br><br><font color=\"#BFBFBF\">[negligible background noise for 4 seconds]<br>[ambient temperature spike, fuel combustion hazard]<\/font><br><br><font color=\"#BFBFBF\">\/\/NOVA NOTE: This is way less funny. Get out of here, virtual popcorn, momma\u2019s got work to do.<br>[open mail client, begin message: Dear Ambra, please don\u2019t blow up Nova. Have you ever tried just chilling out? You should try it sometime. Also, please check your messages.]<br>\/\/NOVA NOTE: Aaaand send. That ought to do it. Way to go, me.<\/font><br><br><font color=\"#CC0000\">AMBRA:<\/font> \u2026No one is going to ask? No one is the LEAST BIT CURIOUS as to the Jennerit peoples\u2019 cultural festivities?<br><br><font color=\"#FF9900\">SHAYNE:<\/font> Does it involve blood sacrifice?<br><br><font color=\"#33CCCC\">KLEESE:<\/font> A day of gladiatorial games and sad music on the organ?<br><br><font color=\"#00FF00\">ALANI:<\/font> Oh, oh, I bet it involves triangles!<br><br><font color=\"#B2CC80\">MONTANA:<\/font> Triangle-palooza!<br><br><font color=\"#00FF00\">MELLKA:<\/font> The Triangulation Ceremony!<br><br><font color=\"#FF9900\">SHAYNE:<\/font> Does it involve blood sacrifice of gladiatorial triangles?<br><br><font color=\"#CC0000\">AMBRA:<\/font> No, no, no, NO, NO! It involves, and is named, none of those things! Now see here, you filthy little\u2014<br><br><font color=\"#CC0000\">DEANDE:<\/font> \u2014Solus Day.<br><br><font color=\"#BFBFBF\">[ambient temperature falling]<br>[open mail client, begin message: Dear Deande, less-than-symbol, three.

I was going to message it out to the other factions\u2019 leadership as a proposed name we can all agree on. Starting at dawn, Exodus, our orbital mega-ship, follows Solus\u2019 path across the sky, gradually eclipsing more and more of Solus until it reaches its zenith.<br><br><font color=\"#FF9900\">AUROX:<\/font> YES, AND?<br><br><font color=\"#CC0000\">DEANDE:<\/font> And then there\u2019s an artificial total eclipse. It\u2019s quite a thrilling spectacle. Exodus overtakes Solus, the eclipse ends, there\u2019s a Viper flyover, a masquerade, et cetera, et cetera.<br><br><font color=\"#B2CC80\">OSCAR MIKE:<\/font> Oh, man, that sounds amazing! I wonder if we\u2019ll see the eclipse from Nova.<br><br><font color=\"#FF9900\">WHISKEY FOXTROT:<\/font> No, Mike, that\u2019s not how\u2026you know what, screw it.<br><br><font color=\"#CC0000\">DEANDE:<\/font> If you\u2019d like, you\u2019re more than welcome to join us."

Or what\u2019s LEFT of those pitifully collagenic patellae you generously call \u201cknees\u201d. As your primary-and-only-competent-care physician, I really must recommend we work something mechanical in there. Maybe\u2026tritanium? All you UPR grunts love tritanium!<br><br><font color=\"#B2CC80\">GHALT:<\/font> Yeah, on the OUTSIDE. Replacing my skeleton? SO not gonna happen.<br><br><font color=\"#CC0000\">BEATRIX:<\/font> Your loss. Captain, would you kindly bring the next patient in?<br><br><font color=\"#B2CC80\">OSCAR MIKE:<\/font> Sup, Cap\u2014hey, where\u2019s the doctor?<br><br><font color=\"#CC0000\">BEATRIX:<\/font> You\u2019re looking at her. Have a seat, Mr\u2026Mike. I\u2019m going to need you to remove your combat armor and helmet.<br><br><font color=\"#B2CC80\">OSCAR MIKE:<\/font> My\u2026what? No way! I\u2019m just here for the free band-aids.<br><br><font color=\"#CC0000\">BEATRIX:<\/font> Is he always like this?<br><br><font color=\"#B2CC80\">GHALT:<\/font> Pretty much.<br><br><font color=\"#CC0000\">BEATRIX:<\/font> Oscar, I\u2019m going to ask one more time: pretty please, with sugar on top\u2026<br><br><font color=\"#B2CC80\">OSCAR MIKE:<\/font> Look, if I wasn\u2019t in MEGA-PEAK CONDITION, could I do THIS? Bam! Totally healthy, no armor removal necessary!<br><br><font color=\"#CC0000\">BEATRIX:<\/font> I was hoping it would come to this.<br><br><font color=\"#B2CC80\">OSCAR MIKE:<\/font> To what?<br><br><font color=\"#CC0000\">BEATRIX:<\/font> We don\u2019t have an infracarbon-saw aboard this ship\u2026yet. But I pride myself on innovation in the face of adversity, and I\u2019ve made some\u2026mostly positive findings thus far with this bladed boomerang I borrowed, and an electric toothbrush I\u2019ve recoupled to the med-bay\u2019s primary generator. This should be interesting. Nova, begin recording.<br><br><font color=\"#33CCCC\">NOVA:<\/font> Hm? Oh, I record pretty much everything, everywhere, all the time.<br><br><font color=\"#CC0000\">BEATRIX:<\/font> Now THAT\u2019S creepy. Remind me to check your archives later. Captain, restrain the patient.<br><br><font color=\"#B2CC80\">OSCAR MIKE:<\/font> Uhhhh\u2026CAPTAIN, PERMISSION TO NOT BE RESTRAINED. Ha! Take THAT, spooky doctor girl!<br><br><font color=\"#B2CC80\">GHALT:<\/font> Permission denied.<br><br><font color=\"#B2CC80\">OSCAR MIKE:<\/font> You can do that?<br><br><font color=\"#B2CC80\">GHALT:<\/font> Yup. Unless you want to lose that chest plate and helmet, soldier.<br><br><font color=\"#B2CC80\">OSCAR MIKE:<\/font> But\u2026it\u2019s cold! Awww, man!<br><br><font color=\"#B2CC80\">GHALT:<\/font> And the base layer.<br><br><font color=\"#CC0000\">BEATRIX:<\/font> He\u2019s blue?<br><br><font color=\"#B2CC80\">GHALT:<\/font> Well, sure. What, you\u2019ve never seen a Galahadrim\u2019s skin before?<br><br><font color=\"#CC0000\">BEATRIX:<\/font> They lose their pigment on expiry.<br><br><font color=\"#B2CC80\">GHALT:<\/font> What does\u2014oh. Yeah, he\u2019s blue.<br><br><font color=\"#B2CC80\">OSCAR MIKE:<\/font> Do you need me to open my mouth and say \u201cahhh\u201d?<br><br><font color=\"#CC0000\">BEATRIX:<\/font> No. In fact, do the opposite. Keep it closed, say nothing.<br><br><font color=\"#BFBFBF\">[negligible background noise for 10 seconds]<\/font><br><br><font color=\"#CC0000\">BEATRIX:<\/font> Incredible\u2026and you\u2019re certain this is one of the RDC\u2019s quick-culture clones?<br><br><font color=\"#B2CC80\">GHALT:<\/font> Yeah, I\u2019ve got it on pretty good authority.<br><br><font color=\"#B2CC80\">OSCAR MIKE:<\/font> Don\u2019t tell the others!<br><br><font color=\"#B2CC80\">GHALT:<\/font> Riiiight. Anyway, why do you ask?<br><br><font color=\"#CC0000\">BEATRIX:<\/font> He\u2019s actually remarkably healthy compared to most Galahadrim I\u2019ve examined. I mean, all my specimens were also dead and suffering from a variety of injuries, but even so, almost all of them had evidence of pre-existing conditions stemming from ribosomal degradation. It\u2019s exceedingly rare for the quick-culture process to \u201ctake\u201d without a host of issues arising\u2026at least, not without specific care to the specimens throughout the maturation phase.<br><br><font color=\"#B2CC80\">OSCAR MIKE:<\/font> See? What\u2019d I tell ya! I\u2019m pretty much the greatest.<br><br><font color=\"#CC0000\">BEATRIX:<\/font> Captain, why did the UPR select Galahadrim for the program? As opposed to, say, Aplians? Their musculature is significantly further developed. Or the Aviants? Superior mobility, collectivistic instincts, quicker gestation, shorter juvenile period\u2026<br><br><font color=\"#B2CC80\">GHALT:<\/font> Well, originally, it was going to be an Aplian-based program, but changed to Galahadrim just a few months before the program began for a couple of reasons\u2026<br><br><font color=\"#B2CC80\">OSCAR MIKE:<\/font> Further developed MY ASS! Captain! Permission to wrestle!<br><br><font color=\"#B2CC80\">GHALT:<\/font> Denied.<br><br><font color=\"#B2CC80\">OSCAR MIKE:<\/font> Damn!<br><br><font color=\"#CC0000\">BEATRIX:<\/font> Yes, but why, Trevor, WHY did it change? If there\u2019s some Galahadrim-specific physiological component of the cloning process, I need to know, both for my own research and to adequately care for Mr. Mike and Mr. Foxtrot.<br><br><font color=\"#B2CC80\">GHALT:<\/font> No, no, it\u2019s nothing like that, it\u2019s. Well. Have you ever seen Montana eat?<br><br><font color=\"#CC0000\">BEATRIX:<\/font> Oh. Oh my. The caloric intake necessary to feed an army of mountains must be\u2014<br><br><font color=\"#B2CC80\">GHALT:<\/font> \u201cExpensive as all hell,\u201d was the official line. The Galahadrim\u2014<br><br><font color=\"#CC0000\">BEATRIX:<\/font> I\u2019ve seen their digestive tracts before, opened stomachs with corroded rocks and raw meat mixed with standard UPR rations. They\u2019re efficient. I see. And the other reason?<br><br><font color=\"#B2CC80\">GHALT:<\/font> Hm?<br><br><font color=\"#CC0000\">BEATRIX:<\/font> You said \u201ca couple of reasons\u201d, what\u2019s the other reason for Galahadrim clones?<br><br><font color=\"#B2CC80\">GHALT:<\/font> Oh. Uh. Well, at the time, the UPR was going through an aggressive recruitment campaign, you know, lots of \u201cvisit exotic places and blow them up!\u201d kinda posters\u2026<br><br><font color=\"#CC0000\">BEATRIX:<\/font> I don\u2019t follow.<br><br><font color=\"#B2CC80\">GHALT:<\/font> Well, the UPR\u2019s Ministry of Media decided that some blue would\u2026[sigh]\u2026\u201dpop\u201d more. And we didn\u2019t have a big enough population of Helicians, something about \u201cstaple variance factors\u201d, I think?<br><br><font color=\"#CC0000\">BEATRIX:<\/font> Stable variance factorization. You need a particular threshold of genetic diversity to carry out a mass-cloning operation such that any unforeseen mutations don\u2019t propagate enough generational momentum to impact the population as a whole.<br><br><font color=\"#B2CC80\">GHALT:<\/font> Uh huh.<br><br><font color=\"#CC0000\">BEATRIX:<\/font> So\u2026he\u2019s blue.<br><br><font color=\"#B2CC80\">GHALT:<\/font> Yup.<br><br><font color=\"#B2CC80\">OSCAR MIKE:<\/font> And BADASS! And healthy as heck!<br><br><font color=\"#CC0000\">BEATRIX:<\/font> Right. Well, I have some archived footage to review. Oscar, I believe we\u2019ve BOTH earned ourselves a piece of candy.<br><br><font color=\"#B2CC80\">GHALT:<\/font> Candy?<br><br><font color=\"#BFBFBF\">[Drawers opening and closing, metal clattering]<\/font><br><br><font color=\"#CC0000\">BEATRIX:<\/font> Captain, WHERE is the candy?<br><br><font color=\"#B2CC80\">GHALT:<\/font> Uhhh\u2026<br><br><font color=\"#CC0000\">BEATRIX:<\/font> HOW can I be expected to perform my medical duties if I CAN\u2019T PROPERLY INCENTIVIZE MY PATIENTS? Or my SELF? Or my assistant!<br><br><font color=\"#B2CC80\">GHALT:<\/font> Assistant?<br><br><font color=\"#CC0000\">BEATRIX:<\/font> I\u2019m filing a requisition order. Nova! We need candy for the med-bay!"

Rath forged a phasic blade specifically adapted to fit Caldarius' Shock armor using the metal from the very walls of his cell ([Deathblade_WithCaldarius_LoreReward]).<br><br>For a while it was believed he went rogue going under the alias of \"The Kemessian\", hellbent on getting his revenge on the Jennerit Elite who were responsible for all his suffering.
